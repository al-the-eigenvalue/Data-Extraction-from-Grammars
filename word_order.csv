Timucua,"The English-Timucua index should be viewed solely as a
finder-list - Timucua forms are simply listed in decreasing
order of frequency where possible, otherwise alphabetically, in
their canonical forms. To obtain additional information the user
must consult the Timucua-English dictionary section of the
volume itself. I do not apologize for the presence of such words
as 'flagellation' and 'choir' and the absence of more everyday
words such as 'frog'. The choice was a given from the sources
and represents neither a free nor a complete vocabulary
selection. While regrettable, the resulting Timucua lexicon is
sizable enough to be of considerable value from any point of
view.

Timucua," In some instances a morphemic verb may be immediately
preceded by an independent pronoun, as a separate lexeme,
either as subject or object. The distinction between subject and
object, discussed subsequently in this section, is made clear by
the constituent parts of the morphemic verb itself.
VERB SUBJECT
SLOT 1 in the morphemic verb matrix is filled by a
pronominal prefix indicating person but not number of the verb
subject. The 1st person form variants occur with approximately
equal frequency, as in hontala 'I am', chihubasotele 'you love
(someone)', nihubasola 'I love (someone)'.

 TIMUCUA GRAMMAR
SYNT ACTIC PARTS OF SPEECH
While there are only four parts of speech by form in
Timucua - verbs, nouns, pronouns, and particles - six syntactic
parts of speech may be defined: verbs, nouns, pronouns,
modifiers, demonstratives, and conjunctions. One may not assume
that morphemic verbs become syntactic verbs, morphemic nouns
syntactic nouns, and so on. Syntactic parts of speech are defined
by the phrase, clause, and sentence context of lexemes regardless
of their morphemic constituents. Such syntactic transformations
will be defined below.
PHRASE STRUCTURE
Phrases and clauses are usually defined as lexemic
structures bounded by some kind of transition phenomena. The
'phrase' is usually considered a binary lexemic structure in which
one member acts as head-word and the second member fulfills
various kinds of syntactic functions. Head-word status in most
languages is accorded that phrase member which belongs to the
statistically more frequent morphemic part of speech of the two
members. In Timucua texts finite morphemic verbs occur with
the highest statistical frequency, non-finite verbs are second,
inflected nouns are third, uninflected nouns fourth, particles
fifth, and pronouns sixth and last. This frequency will be taken
as the rank-order for defining head-words in Timucua binary
phrases. Thus a phrase containing a morphemic verb and a
morphemic noun will be considered a VERB PHRASE; one
containing a morphemic noun and a morphemic particle will be
called a NOUN PHRASE. In phrases containing two equally
ranked morphemic parts of speech the first member is dominant,
to judge from Pareja's translations.

In VERB PHRASES -
(I) particle or pronoun> Pronoun
(2) noun = Noun
(3) non-finite verb> Modifier
In NOUN PHRASES -
(4) noun> Modifier
(5) particle:> Demonstrative
CLAUSE STRUCTURE
Clause-constituents in Timucua are: subject, complement (=
direct or indirect object), predicate, and clause modifier. Any of
these constituents may be single lexemes or phrases. The normal
order of these elements is - SU BJ ECT, COM PLEM ENT ,
PREDICATE. Clause modifiers usually occur before the
clause-constituent they modify.

ossibilities. In Lesson 1 we mentioned the fact that subject and verb
in simple intransitive sentences can occur either in the order subject-
verb or the order verb-subject.

been moved to the end, but they occur in the reverse order from that
found in (4b). Note also that when the object follows the postposition
(examples 4c and 4d) the determiner g is present.
The following are examples of the four word-order possibilities for
postpositional phrases discussed above.

Pipil," ""The man killed the cow.""
 The orders:
 Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
 Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)
also occur, but with less frequency. The order SVO is used speci-
fically to place greater emphasis on the subject. The VSO order is
rare except when the object is ""heavy"", i.e. when it contains a
relative clause or a coordinate noun phrase. In this way Pipil
conforms to the word-order universal that has been postulated for
VOS languages that a ""heavy"" object is not permitted and is usually
shifted to the end, giving VSO with heavy objects as a very common
corollary order in basically VOS languages (cf, Campbell and Mithun
1981).
",1,No dominant order,,,0,1,
Pipil,"""The little boy rejoiced.""
The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is:

frequency in texts and conversation, and it is the only order for
transitive sentences which i s neutral with respect to focus and
emphasis (see below).",0,No dominant order,,,0,1,

 Intransitive sentences, on the other hand, rarely deviate from
the basic Verb-Subject (VS) order. The combination Verb-Object

pronominal and hence signaled by a verb prefix.",,No dominant order,,,0,1,

 Introduction
()• Introduction
The native language of western El Salvador, the subject of this
book, is known in the linguistic literature as Pipil, although its
speakers call it na:wat in the language itself and Nahuate in
Spanish, Here it is called Pipil because this usage is so strongly
entrenched in the scientific literature that it could not easily be
changed. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that Naswat (Nahuate) may
gain more general acceptance in honor of and in deference to its
speakers.",,No dominant order,,,0,1,

 In German, word order is important only to a certain degree. It is mainly case marking that is
decisive in determining SUBJ and DO. Like in Spanish, the SUBJ is in the NOM and the DO in the ACC.
The basic word order is the same as in English and Spanish, namely SVO/SV. Differences occur in (c) and
the examples (d1, d2) where we have marked prominence and the constituent order changes to SOV,
OSV, and OVS respectively. In (d1) the SUBJ prominence is clearly marked, and in (d2) the sentence
initial DO cannot be confused with the SUBJ due to the ACC case which reflects the DO function. One
difficulty one faces in German, is that different cases on occasion are homophonous. Therefore I chose
der Kater ‘the male cat’ rather than die Katze ‘the female cat’ which is the generic term for ‘cat’ in
German. Like in English and Spanish, so in German tense/aspect do not affect the constituent order or
the case marking.

Amahuaca,"Again following the general trend, Amahuaca is best classified as an SOV language (Wise 1979), but
not in an exclusive sense. Whereas dependent clauses (particularly clauses in a chain with IR-
morphology) strongly prefer SOV/SV word order, independent clauses and sentences display more
freedom. Their word order depends on verbal aspect4 and pragmatic considerations (which in the context
of this paper means that a sentence constituent or a clause is considered prominent). While independent
sentences in unmarked aspect have SOV/SV word order (e.g. 1 below), those in marked aspect display
OVS/VS word order (e.g. 2 below). Other orders (OVS/VS in unmarked aspect and SOV/SV in marked
aspect) are clearly pragmatically marked (e.g. 3a, 3b below).
1.1 The case-marking system
The case-marking system is basically tripartite with ergative, absolutive, and nominative cases (Table
1.1). 5 In pragmatically neutral independent clauses, split ergativity is governed by verbal aspect.
(1) Unmarked aspect, transitive and intransitive verb.

Amahuaca," SV
 Generally the subject (SUBJ) is sentence-initial, be it pragmatically marked or not. It precedes the
verb and the direct object (DO) (if the verb is TR). Only in (56d) the DO precedes the SUBJ due to the
fact that it is pragmatically marked and the verb is sentence-final. It can be said then that in English the

prominent constituent, the SUBJ, is sentenc-initial and the basic word order in active voice is SVO/SV.

Pilagá," It has been argued that the basic word order is AVO/SV in Toba (Messineo, pc.)
and in Mocovi (Gualdieri 1998, Grondona 1998), and I state that the same holds for
Pilaga- For Kadiwk however, Sandal0 (1995) states that word order is free, and the
object or the subject NP can come in any position with respect to the verb. But since
most, if not all, Guaykuruan languages belong to the pronominal argument type (i.e.,
subject and object firactions are not distinctively encoded by phrase structure), word
order variation is not unexpected. What strikes oae as coommon to all the descriptions of
Southern Guaylatruan languages elaborated so far is that the position of the NP sqbject
presents more variation than the position of the NP object. It is, therefore, possible that
what have been considered ""subject"" NPs in the analysis of word order pattans are, in
fact, adjuncts, and for that reason occurrence of a lexical NP coreferential with the
subject is neither obligatory nor is its position within the clause hed. Synchronically
Pilaga and Toba belong to the Verb-initial type, and probably Mocovi too, suggesting the
existence of a synctacticized pattern at least for the languages of the Southern
Guaykunran branch. There are some traces in the grammar of Toba and Pilaga that
suggest that at least some languages ofthe Southern Guaykuruan branch could have been
OV (or Dependent-Head) in their origins, evolving towards a verb-intial type in a later
stage.

Pilagá,"9.2.3 Word Order
 As noted in 9.1, Pilaga exhibits two basic constituent orders in declarative
sentences: transitive (A)VO and intransitive VS. Some variation on these dominant
patterns is possible, as will become clear from the discussion found in this section-
 In 9.1, we saw possible variation in the order of noun phrases when the verb
governs two objects (ditransitives will be -ertreated in 9.2). In this section, however,
I will concentrate on word order in intransitive and transitive clauses, that is the
discussion is restricted to clauses with one core-argument and with two core-arguments.

Pilagá," Texts performed by tradiional speakers do show cases of SV arrangement. This is
illustrated in ( 14 H15). (14) comes 60m a mmtive about the ""Origin of Women"",told
by Alberto NavamteAt the point of clause (14), he describes how the
guard of the camp, the mythical bird Wole, calls the fishamen back to the camp to see
the women, w h o had just fallen 60omsky into earth The intransitive verb ~aEawo
describes the motionaun trajectory of the men (so' sivadipi).

and CL people d 3 - m o v e - D I R then IS-setA3-move-DIR CL Poss3-camp
 'And the people came; then they came t o their camp.'
 Instances of postverbal lexical subjects in transitive clauses (i.e.,VA) are very rare,
though possible. In (1 5 ) so' npotanek 'the guard' occurs &er the transitive verb.
asnak hokal'i so' npotanek ""am'i y-aqayaaw-seda-iiiho' ""
setA.3-say then CL guard2PL Poss.l-brother setAZ-cawe,write-DIR dem
'The guard said ""You,my brothers, dig there.""
 Therefore, according to ( 14) and (1 5), AV and VA for transitive clauses, but also
VS and SV with intransitives, are possible for the position of the lexical NP subject. One
interpretation of these distribution Gets is that, since the lexical expression of the subject
is not obligatory (except when a participant is introduced for the first time in the
discourse), the noun phrase explicitly mentioning the subject must have the status of an
adjunct, instead of being truly m e n t a l , and this is the reason why it does not have a
rigid position within the clause. Any possible effkct of intonation and pauses on word
order variability needs to be investigated on the basis of texts; it might be the case that
adjoined phrases do not form a phonological unit with the rest of the predicate, but are
phrased separately fiom the rest of the clause
 Up to this point, I have argued that the dominant constituent orders are VS for
intransitives and (A)VO (or VO) for transitive clauses;but also that in the m t i v e s by
older speakers there are instances of SV and VA order. I have found that word order
variabilility correlates with a generational difference, but this correlation needs to be
explored in more depth. In oral and written texb by younger speakers, the correlation
with the AVONS amgement is very strong. Setting written texts aside, which are
obviously more planned and lack the intonationaljunctures and pauses typical of an oral
performance, I compared the information provided by older speakers with the oral
narratives produced by younger speakers. With a very high consistency, subject and
object noun phrases follow the basic (A)VONS patterns in the narratives of younger
Pilaga speakers, while those provided by older traditional speakers show the word order
variants described above.

16 Basic word order
16.1General patterns
Yurok word order is ﬂexible. It is often possible to
arrange the words in the same sentence in two or
more diﬀerent ways, all of them quite acceptable.
The order that speakers choose may depend more
on emphasis and the nature of their conversation
or story than on purely syntactic rules. But several
clear patterns can be noted here.
One obvious pattern is that preverbs come before
the verb; this is why they are called pre-verbs. For
example, with preverbs underlined in (107):
(107) a. Keech ho nep’ puuek.

Basic Yurok grammar §5 | November 2010
5Word classes
In any language, words can be grouped into various , which are deﬁned partly by their meaning
and partly by how they are used in sentences. It is useful to identify the word classes of a language because
then you can make general statements about them, for example, “Yurok nouns do not usually change
according to whether they are singular or plural” and “Yurok preverbs are positioned before the verb”.
Though there are many similarities across languages, word classes do diﬀer from language to language.
For example, English has a class of ; Yurok does not. In Yurok, the meanings that are expressed
by English adjectives are instead expressed by the class of verbs. Likewise, English has no class of 
despite the importance of this word class in Yurok grammar. English also lacks - .
Every Yurok word belongs to one of the ten word classes below.
5.1 Verbs
Verbs in the broad sense actually consist of two distinct word classes:
• A  is a kind of word that usually changes its form according to the subject (and possibly the
 object) of the sentence, and that usually refers to a kind of activity or state. English verbs include
 know, run, sing. A Yurok verb is komchuemek’ “I know it”, which changes its form according to the
 subject (and sometimes the object), as illustrated by this selection of forms:
komchuemek’“I know it”komchuechek’“I know you”
komchuemem’“you know it”komchuepa’“you know me”
komchuem’“he or she knows it” komchuesek’ “I know him or her”

Yurok," “A voyage will be made to Crescent City tomorrow.” YL 1951
Preverbs never show the word order ﬂexibility of adverbs. Some other patterns, discussed in the next
section, concern the relative order of nouns and verbs.
16.2Nouns and verbs
It is uncommon for a sentence in ordinary usage to have more than one noun, and it is not rare for a
sentence to have no nouns. But if there is a noun, it may be positioned either before or after its verb. As
a rule,      will be positioned before the verb. Any others will be positioned after
the verb, and it is even possible that all nouns will be positioned after the verb.

standard strategies to detect basic word order — statistical frequency, descriptive
simplicity, and pragmatic neutrality —is without problems. As a result, some scholars
have questioned the universality of the very notion of basic word order; when languages
display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, some scholars
advocate asking a different question, namely “what is the communicative function of
one order, rather than another” (Mithun 1992, Payne 1990, 1992). Thus, the first
typological division should be made between those languages in which word order
primarily correlates with grammatical factors, and those in which word order primarily
correlates with pragmatic factors (Thompson 1978).

 Starting with Greenberg (1963), there has been a fundamental assumption in

among others). This constitutes one way of categorizing languages in typology.

Starting with Greenberg (1963), there has been an assumption in linguistics that
for a majority of languages it is possible to identify a “basic” order of subject and object
 44
with respect to the verb (Hawkins 1983, Dryer 1992, among others). This has constituted
a way of categorizing languages in typology. However, what is basic in terms of order
and how to identify it remains debatable. As a consequence, some scholars have
suggested that the first typological division should be made between those languages in
which word order primarily correlates with pragmatic factors, and those in which order
primarily correlates with grammatical factors (Thompson 1978). Thus, in languages
which display several order patterns, instead of asking “what is the basic order”, it should
be asked “what is the communicative function of one order, rather than another” (Payne
1990, 1992). In order to answer this question, explanatory factors beyond syntax, such as
information structure and pragmatics, must be taken into consideration. The case of
Kokama-Kokamilla is interesting because both grammatical relations and pragmatics play
a prominent role in the distribution of the different order patterns.
 1.5.3. The syntax-discourse interface
KK highlights points of theoretical interest regarding discourse-pragmatic issues.
The language displays interesting patterns of interaction between information structure
and syntax. Although word order is perhaps one of the main strategies for expressing
discourse-pragmatic factors, there are several other components playing a role within
specific constructions. For instance, tense-marked clauses, aspect-marked clauses, and
clauses unmarked for tense and aspect have a skewed distribution in discourse, and the
driving factor is the background/foreground narrative distinction (Vallejos 2007). Another
issue concerns the distribution of pronominal forms. The language exhibits three sets of
pronominal forms: free long form pronouns, short form free pronouns, and enclitics. The
45
choice between these forms is iconically motivated: short form pronouns occur by default,
typically refering to information which is low in salience; clitics are the further reductions
of short forms, used to refer to recurring participants in core grammatical relations; long
forms are used for highlighting certain aspects of a complex experience, and to attract the
hearer‟s attention to one part of a sentence (Vallejos 2005). Further, information-
structural distinctions, such as argument focus, predicate focus and predication focus, are
signaled by the interaction of word order, morphological markers, and prosody (Vallejos
2009). Topics dealing with the syntax-discourse interface are discussed in Chapter XI.
",0,SVO,"Based on the information provided, it is not clear what the dominant word order in the language described in the grammar is. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information"".",Not enough information,0,0,упоминание порядка слов
Cocama," The speakers of KK have several constituent order patterns at their disposal, and
this section explores the factors that speakers take into consideration when choosing one
of those patterns at the moment of the utterance. It was found that some patterns are
used to mark certain pieces of information as pragmatically salient. Here I use salient in
the sense of Mithun‟s (1993) newsworthy, for referring to unexpected information (i.e.
which breaks shared cultural knowledge and expectations), answers to information
questions, restatements, topic shifting, etc. In Givón‟s words, salient information would
 730
be considered more informative than non/less-salient information. Informativeness can
be seen as a composite of several parameters: it correlates with new as opposed to
given, indefinite as opposed to definite, contrastive as opposed to non-contrastive. In
general, it involves less predictable information (Givon 1983).
 11.4.1. Available ordering patterns
 As discussed in Chapters IX, §9.1.1, in KK word order partially defines the
syntactic role of an argument. Although neither tense nor aspect morphology is required
as part of a basic clause, a clause allows a different order of subject, object and verb
depending on whether or not it is marked for progressive aspect. The available patterns
are listed in Table 11.6; for examples that illustrate these patterns, please see Chapter
VIII.15
 Table 11.6: Summary of word order patterns

 Recall that tense works as a system of enclitics on the verb phrase, whereas the
progressive aspect is a verbal suffix. In tense-marked and unmarked clauses, allowable
patterns are (O)SV and SV(O), but the order *SOV is not allowed. In progressive-
marked clauses, allowable patterns are S(O)V and (O)VS, but the order *OSV is not

 That said, it is possible to encounter other orders in elicitation; note also that other orderings are also
possible if auxiliary verbs are added to the clause.

Cocama," The first parameter in which subjects differ from objects is in their position with
respect to the verb. As shown in §9.1.1, KK cannot have “free” word order. Because
order is what determines the interpretation of subject and object, arguments must occur
 511
in specific positions adjacent to the verb. Within the non-progressive construction type
(i.e., clauses unmarked for tense and aspect), in intransitive clauses the subject precedes
the verb: [SUBJ V]. That is, the intransitive construction requires a noun phrase (59a) or
a pronoun (59b) fulfilling the subject argument function, plus a verb that can combine
with this argument structure construction.

 „Two peccaries escape‟ (ED)
b. etse yachu
 1SG.L.Fcry
„I cry‟ (ED)
c. tsa=yamimi
1SG.F=hide
„I hide‟ (ED)
As illustrated above, the subject could be a full NP like mukuika tsayatsu‘two
peccaries‟ (59a), or a pronoun, either unbound like etse „I‟ (59b) or cliticized to the
verb, like tsa= „I‟ in (7c).

Khanty," 10.1.1.3 Simple Clause Word Order
It is evident from (67,68, 71, 73, 74, 76, 78, 79) above that in Eastern Khanty, the Agent
 referent is often elided from the explicit expression, being marked by the co-referential
 agreement inflection on the verbal predicate. Nevertheless, it is also noticeable that the
 dominant and fairly rigid linear word order in the Eastern Khanty simple clause is SOV. Of
 course, in the discussion to follow, as in previous sections, it should be born in mind, that
 word-order is assumed to be a complex multi-factorial domain, where generalizations are
 more often scalar rather than discrete (cf. Givon 200 1: 234).
",1,SOV,"The dominant and fairly rigid linear word order in the Eastern Khanty simple clause is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). Therefore, the answer is ""SOV"".",SOV,0,0,
Khanty,"Eastern Khanty also displays quite strong correlation between the clausal word-order
 (SOV) and the order in the noun phrase (modifier-head, pre-nominal modification), thus
U Z-TRANSLATIONS.NET
 365
 supporting the general SOV cross-linguistic pattern (Greenberg 1966). As covered in the
 section on the noun phrase, all Eastern Khanty noun modifiers strongly tend to precede the
 modified head (cf. 9.Noun Phrase):

 There are examples, though, with the larger nominal modifiers such as Relative clauses
 which able to appear both in pre-nominal, harmonic OV order, as well as in the post-nominal,
 disharmonic va order (141):
 141. rna u-l-~mkatkatl-~msoy
1sg see-Prst-1 sg hand hold-PPstick
'I see the hand holding the walking stick'
 This, on one hand, may be assumed to be the contact influence from theva Russian
 language. On the other hand (142), it is an evidence of the existing scale in formal and
 semantic features of the Eastern Khanty relative clauses, where finite post-nominal instances
U Z-TRANSLATIONS.NET
366
 combine the features of both subordination and coordination (cf. 11.2.3.Finite Linked
 Clauses with the Function of Relative Clause)
 142. man-n~ on~l-l-~m tom qu iu-w~l
 lsg-Loc know-Prst-lsgthat man walk-Prst.3sg
'I know the man, who is walking there'
 In any case, larger nominal modifiers such as relative clauses occurring in the post-head
 position, are consistent with the major word-order alteration pattern in Eastern Khanty,
 namely looser or flexible ordering of OV licensed by the pragmatic status of the Target role.

features as: Agent argument controlling verbal agreement inflection, high agentivity of this
 argument, verb-final word order, and perfective aspect of the transitive verb. However, there
 are a few differentiating features as well:

 As we saw in Chapter 5, any Object, including the recipient of a bitransitive
 verb or the beneficiary of a verb with benefactive marking, may accept Object
 marking. This section will examine under what circumstances Object marking is
 obligatory, and under what circumstances it is optional.
 In order to describe the relative tendencies of NPs to bear Object marking, we
must first develop an Empathy hierarchy. NPs conforming to the types to the
 left are higher in empathy than those to the right. Object NPs of the highest
empathy always take Object marking. Those of the lowest empathy rarely take
Object marking, and those in between have a greater or lesser propensity to
take it. This depends particularly upon whether or not the object NP is
definite, and the relative empathy of the object and the subject. The
conditions under which object NPs take Object marking are discussed in detail
in section 6.2.

Awtuw," CHAPTER 4
VERBAL MORPHOSYNTAX
 4.1S t r u c t u r e o f t h e verb complex
Many of the affixes discussed in this chapter have already appeared in section
 2.2. There I was concerned with the changes phonemes undergo in the presence
of other specified phonemes and boundaries in the verb complex and elsewhere.
Here, I describe the formal morphological similarities and differences among
verbs, the CO-occurrence of affixes, and the meanings and functions of the
affixes. Illustrative paradigms are to be found at the end of this chapter.
We can begin by examining a few highly expanded forms of typical verbs to
illustrate the overall structure of the verb complex and the order of the
elements that it comprises. For the sake of intelligibility, I will first
display a table of the slots in the verb complex and the affixes that may fill
them, and then present the evidence for the analysis. With the exception of
slot +l, the lists of affixes for each slot are exhaustive. I discuss the
affixes that occur in slot +l fully in section 4.12.
CO-occurrence restrictions make three examples necessary to illustrate the
relative order of affixes in all slots. I will discuss these in subsequent
sections.
Example (1) shows the relative order of affixes in slots -8, -7, -6, -5, -4,
-3, 0, +l, + 2 , and +5.
",0,SOV,"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the dominant word order of the language described in the grammar. The chapter discussed verbal morphosyntax and the structure of the verb complex, but it did not provide information on the word order of the language. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information"".",Not enough information,0,0,порядок аффиксов
Awtuw," A few
 other words end in /nk/, although there are no examples of word-final /mp/ or
 /nt/ clusters. The cluster /rp/ occurs in /kinirp/ close ( t h e door)! and two
 other forms of dose.
 Aside from these, there are a few examples of words ending in a semivowel and
 a stop or a nasal such as /tuwp/ s t r a i g h t ( 3 ~ a y/kuwm/
 ~b o g (on t h e s k i n ) , and
 /uyk/ odour.
 Word-medial clusters of two or three consonants are very common. Sequences of
 three stops are possible in this position, as in the following examples:
 /apt ' ka re/ don't you two get it
 /d i knaekp'tat i y/i s frightening
 It is interesting to note that the stop sequence in the first example crosses
 two morpheme boundaries, but the second example includes the unique root
 rp~pisi,which has a three stop cluster within the root.
Other clusters that occur word medially include sequences of two semivowels,
 and of semivowels and taps or laterals:
 /wi ywa re/w i l l bathe
 /rokoryaka/broken
/ma l wa re/w i l l descend
/wi wyare/wilt, incise
/way row re/W< it f l o a t
/dotko l ye/killed
2.1.5 Stress placement
By and large, main word stress, which entails a rise in pitch and a slight
increase in loudness, tends to fall on the first syllable of an Awtuw word.
There is also a tendency towards penultimate stress. Where the two tendencies
coincide, on disyllabic words, the stress pattern is regular.
/'kinik/sit
/ ' 1 ape/village
/'tapwo/ f i r e
/'eywo/ thus
Where the two tendencies do not coincide, but the first and penultimate
syllables are not adjacent, in polysyllabic words, primary stress will usually
fall on the penult and secondary stress on the first syllable.
/'orkewey""naywo/ four
/ 'atel'paye/ far out!
/'owti y1'kayan/old
/ ' per i yai'yawnow/ grass
There are, however, a number of exceptions to this generalisation among words
other than verbs, while verbs do not appear to follow it at all.
 /yeinankeyke/ grandchild
 /molnokene/ bad
 /kay 'puteri y/ dust
On trisyllabic words other than verbs, where the two tendencies would place
 stress on adjacent syllables, some words follow one tendency and others the
other.
 big
 small
 mouth
 smoke
 rwer
 moon
 some
 near
The addition of a case marker or derivational suffix does not affect the
position of stress on a word other than a verb.
/wi y ' tape/ river
/wiyttape-ke/ a t the r i v e r
/ ' tapwo/fire
/'tapwo-re/ fire-0
/ ' tapwo-neney/hot
On the whole, verb forms that are not disyllabic do not follow the same
patterns as other words. One generalisation we can make is that the Future and
Desiderative forms of /a/-final roots have primary stress on the root-final/a/.
/'kare/w i l Z get
/ ' rare/w H l eat
/wow'nare/ w i l l sleep

2.2Morphophonology
This section presents a number of ordered rules which together produce most of
the phonetic forms of Awtuw words from strings of morphemes.
On the whole, the rules apply to verb forms, but where other types of words
meet the environmental criteria, these rules affect them as well. The only
cases of such rules are one of the vowel harmony rules (2.2.10), which changes
the canonical /e/ of the past, future, and object suffixes to [I] or [D], and
the pre-rhotic stop insertion rule in 2.2.18.

 CHAPTER 5
GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS AND VERB CLASSES
5. lGrammatical relations
By and large! Awtuw is a lanquaqe that depends heavily on praqmatic real-world
considerations in recovering the role and reference of NPs in a sentence. As a
result, the identification of qrammatical relations is not entirely transparent.
Case marking alone does not constitute a reliable diagnostic for the
identification of grammatical relations for three reasons.
 (l) Although sub-jects never bear case marking! there are other nouns that may
occur in the clause that never bear case marking either (cf. 6.1 and 5.4)-
 (2) Ob-ject marking is obligatory on some direct objects and optional on others
 (cf. 6.2).
 (3) Although indirect ob-jects always bear object markingl certain direct
objects do so too (cf. 6.2).
Furthermore! although Awtuw's basic word order is readily identifiable as verb
final! indeed as SOV, OS order and other permutations are far too common to
allow word order to be of any value in identifying qrammatical relations.
It is possiblel nevertheless! to isolate the three relations on the basis of a
more complicated statement of their case marking properties in combination with
other criteria. It is important to be able to identify qrammatical relations
on formal grounds and without reference to verb semantics because the
classification of verbs in section 5.2 relies on their ability to CO-occur with
NPs in various qrammatical relations.
5.1.1 The sub-ject of a clause has a number of properties that distinguish it
from other grammatical relations.
(l) Firstl as I mentioned abovel the subject never bears case marking. But the
complementary nouns that CO-occur obligatorily with the idiomatic composite
verbs discussed in 5.4 never do so either. Note that in clauses whose sub-ject
is a pronounl a personal namel or an NP with any determiner or modifier! this
problem does not arise because the noun complement of idiomatic complement
constructions is always a sinqle common noun.
A simple substitution test can distinguish the subject in any clause where
there is a doubt as to its identification. The complementary noun in an
idiomatic composite construction is lexically specified. So if we substitute
 an appropriate pronoun coreferential with the noun in questionr and the clause
remains acceptable, we can be certain that that noun is the subject of the
clause. If such a substitution results in an unacceptable clauser then we can
 identify the noun as a complementary noun.

 ( 2 ) Second, only the subject of the clause can trigqer person agreement in
those verb forms - Hortativel Imperativel and Debitive - that are marked for
person. As first- and second-person subjectsl where overtl are always
pronominalr and therefore readily identifiable as subjects by their lack of
case markingl I will illustrate with the third person form.

14.1BASIC CONSTITUENT ORDER IN DECLARATIVE CLAUSES
The basic constituent order in Darma declarative sentences is SV/AOV. This
constituent order is predominant in elicited sentences, but there is some variability to the
order. In some cases the object of a transitive verb precedes the agent. Generally this
392
variability is allowed only when the semantic role of the core arguments is not ambiguous
as a result of the re-ordering (i.e. when the agent is overtly marked with the ergative
postposition). This type of variability is not uncommon in the languages of the world, and
“some languages seem to tolerate surprising amounts of ambiguity” (Andrews 1985:71).
Examples of variable word order are found throughout this dissertation. Here I will focus
solely on the basic constituent order that is found in pragmatically neutral utterances.
",1,SOV,"The language described in the grammar has a dominant word order of ""SV/AOV"", which is predominantly ""SVO"" in declarative sentences.",SVO,1,0,
Darma,"Darma is an OV language, and we find two types of verb complex with multiple
verbs in combination. As Givón suggests, the finite inflection is found on the clause-final
verb, which is not always the main verb (i.e. it is often an auxiliary). While the basic
constituent order is SV/AOV, constituents move about freely, and we find both
grammatical subjects and grammatical objects in extraposed positions. Furthermore, a
primary narrative strategy in Darma includes chaining multiple non-finite clauses
together under a single matrix verb, which Givón asserts is problematic for determining
the structure for the VP, especially if both clauses do not share the same subject. Chained
clauses in Darma are not required to share the same subject. The problem with clause
chains where the subject may or may not be the same in all of the clauses is that the same
structure cannot be used to account for both types of clause. If we posit a structure where
the S node branches into the subject NP followed by two equally dominated VPs, we can
325
account for the same-subject construction, but this does not work for the different-subject
construction (Givón 1995: 217-218).

While an example like (11) above is unusual, it is not ambiguous for several
reasons. First, the word order AOPOSV is maintained, which allows the listener to
understand that the speaker is feeding the baby and not the other way around. Second, the
verb is in the first person singular alerting the listener to the fact that the speaker is the
subject of the clause. Finally, in this example, as in all of the examples of three-
participant constructions found in the corpus, it is possible to disambiguate the roles of
the two internal arguments based on the verb meaning. In this example it is unlikely that
the speaker is being fed milk by the child. Future investigation must obtain examples of
sentences with two animate internal arguments such as ‘I introduced Ram to Sita’. This
type of sentence would reveal whether it is possible to have three participants without
case marking with just word order to disambiguate.
14.1.3.1Primary and Secondary Objects
Kroeger summarizes the patterns commonly found with primary objects and
secondary objects. In terms of case marking: ‘If one object is marked like the object of a
simple (mono-) transitive clause while the other gets a special marker (e.g. dative case;
see Chapter 14), the one with the special marker is probably the OBJ2’ (2005: 62). In
terms of position: ‘If there is no difference in the marking of the two objects, eg. if both
are bare NPs, and if their relative ordering is fixed (or if one ordering can be shown to be
more basic than the other), the object that occurs closest to the verb is more likely to be
the primary object’ (2005: 62). Darma does not follow either pattern described by
Kroeger. The primary object is marked with the dative marker when it appears in an
 396
oblique clause, and in constructions with two objects, the secondary object is closest to
the verb. Examples highlighting each pattern are provided in (15)-(28) below. The dative
marked objects are in bold, when secondary objects are overt, they are in brackets.

14.1.3 Three Participants
 Verbs with three participants are classified as transitive verbs. These verbs are
conjugated using the same morphology as transitive verbs with two arguments (i.e., both
types of verb are found with the d-series of non-past morphemes as discussed in §13.3.1
above). In these sentences the recipient, which I refer to as the (primary) object, follows
394
the agent and precedes the secondary object; the basic order is AOPOSV. This is shown in
examples (9)-(13) below. In example (14) below, we find the same constituent order with
a malfactive (as opposed to a recipient) preceding the secondary object (a further
discussion of objects is presented later in this chapter).

There are examples where the subject of an intransitive clause is marked with the
dative postposition. These are defined as ‘experiencer subjects’; they will be discussed in
§14.3.1.2 below.
14.2.1.2 Patient of Transitive Clause
The patient of a transitive verb is unmarked for case. When an agent is not overtly
marked, an AOV constituent order is maintained. When the agent is overtly marked, the
word order of the sentence is not fixed. Examples (33)-(35) show an overt agent that is
marked with the postposition su. In the first two examples, the AOV constituent order is
maintained. In example (35), however, the AOV word order is scrambled. In this
example, the patient precedes the agent. The agent is followed by the ergative
postposition, and the patient is not marked. According to Andrews (1985:71), scrambling
is not uncommon in the languages of the world ‘providing ambiguity is not introduced’.
He goes on to point out that this statement is not entirely true since ‘some languages seem
400
to tolerate surprising amounts of ambiguity.’ Scrambling is found frequently in Darma,
especially in constructions where the participants are overtly marked with postpositions.

Basque," The Basque language has no accusative case, no special form for the direct object of
a verb (like English him as against he); it has an ergative case, a special form for the
subject—which may or may not be a semantic agent—of a transitive verb. Basque is there-
fore classiﬁed as a morphologically ergative language, which is generally deﬁned as a lan-
guage wherein the subject of an intransitive predicate and the (direct) object of a transitive
verb share a morphological trait not shared by the subject of a transitive predicate. This
shared morphological trait may be realized either directly on the noun phrases involved—
with case marking being the prime example—or else within the verbal morphology by
means of agreement markers referring to subject and/or object. Constituent order, too,
may play a role.

Euskara is a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) type language (de Rijk (1969)). Regarding phrases that do
not agree with the verbal inflection, such as adverbs and postpositional phrases, it is not so clear what
the neutral word order is. For instance, the EGLU grammar provides examples like (3) as neutral
word orders:

The postposition =ra (or suffix -ra) marks transitive subjects (A function). The
absence of a postposition (or a suffix) marks intransitive subjects (S function) or
transitive objects (O function). Oblique functions are also marked by postposi-
tions (or suffixes on pronouns). The main oblique postpositions are associative,
dative, genitive, locative, general locative, perlative and ‘up to’. Most postposi-
tions are enclitics, being attached to the last phonological word of an NP. A few

 correlate of grammatical relations in Galo. Although the statistically most frequent Galo
 constituent order is without question A O V, when the O argument is definite and

 arranged in the most pragmatically useful order. Thus, there is a pragmatic difference

Galo,"Following the generally-accepted framework summarized in Dixon and
Aikhenvald (2002), as set forth in numerous previous works by them and other scholars,
this disconnect will be described here in terms of a difference between two types of unit:
“grammatical word” and “phonological word”. 71 The following subsections review
criteria by which these units may be identified. Some of these criteria involve
exceptionless (or rarely violable) rules, while others consist of more probabilistic
tendencies. In some cases, the convergence among or contrast between grammatical and
phonological words is robust, as in (17)-(18) above. In other cases, the analysis hinges on
thin and contextually variable criteria. The resulting picture is complex, perhaps in some
ways unsatisfyingly so. However, it must be recalled that Galo has heretofore been an
instrument for oral, face-to-face communication, and has not been significantly shaped by
conventionalization for writing purposes. Many of the difficulties found (by linguists and
native speakers alike) in consistently segmenting utterances into “words” for the purpose
of writing the language (as we are doing here) are, when speaking, simply a non-issue. 72
71
 This sense of “grammatical word” is not to be confused with another, unrelated sense in which
“grammatical word” denotes words which have as their value a grammatical function as opposed to a
lexical meaning, i.e. (in English) words like “the”, “to”, and “and” as opposed to “boat” and “tree”. To
avoid confusion, in the present work we use the term “grammatical word” in the Dixon-Aikhenvald sense of
opposition to “phonological word” and the term “function word” to refer to words with grammatical-
functional as opposed to lexical status.
72
 It is also instructive to consider that the word for ‘word’ in Galo agóm (< PTs *gom ‘speech; voice’) also
has the related senses ‘speech’, ‘language’, ‘utterance’, and ‘matter/point’. Thus, it might be more accurate
to gloss agóm as something like ‘communicum’ in the sense of ‘unit and/or medium of communication’,
without regard to segmentation or length. According to this definition (and according to Galo speakers’
usual judgments), both phonological and grammatical words may qualify as agóm (even when these do not
coincide), but neither roots nor affixes do. One might note here a potential similarity with Tibetan (among
other languages), in which multiword utterances, rather than words per se, are separated by spaces when
writing (Sprigg 1955). Importantly, such types contrast with the traditional Chinese concept of the basic
unit of language, the zǐ, which has a lower-level denotation including roots and morphemes, but no unit
153
4.1.1. Grammatical word
 As defined by Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:§7), a grammatical word is
identifiable as a grammatical unit between morpheme and syntactic phrase, whose
constitutents are a head plus immediate (local) dependents, in a fixed, continuous order in
terms of a given semantic value. These identification criteria are probably universal, and
are expanded on only briefly here with reference to examples (17) and (18) above.
 a) indivisibility. Independent words cannot generally interrupt the strings of
morphemes expressed in (17) and (18). 73
 b) patterning as a unit. The strings in (17) and (18) can be moved and modified
within the syntax as wholes, but no subset can.
 c) fixed order. The orders of elements in (17) and (18) are fixed. While certain
sequences of grammatically bound forms (for example, predicate derivations (§11)) are to
an extent variably-ordered in Galo, variation always results in a different meaning; i.e., a
different grammatical word.
 d) status as a syntactic unit. The strings in (17) and (18), taken as wholes, each
realize a predicate (a unit referred to by various syntactic rules, which is a constituent of
various phrase types, etc). No subset of either string in (17) and (18) can qualify as such a
syntactic unit.
 e) grammatical part-whole composition. The functional and structural descriptions
of the parts in (17) and (18) refer to the whole, and the functional and structural
description of the whole makes reference to the parts. No elemental subset of (17) or (18)
relates to another constituent at the same or a higher level.
 f) native speaker awareness of meaning and independent status. Speaking very
generally, a speaker is more likely to feel comfortable uttering and assigning meaning to a
grammatical word in isolation than to one of its subparts. For example, most speakers
sense no difficulty in uttering and assigning meaning to zabdù in (17) out-of-context,
although the same cannot be said of hidù in (18). There are difficulties in applying this
criterion, since native speakers typically experience greater difficulties in assigning
meaning to function words than to lexemes (i.e., go in would go is more easily defined or
larger than a word (Chao 1968). Some modern, linguistically-inclined Galo have coined the term gomcɨ ̀r
(lit., ‘speech pellet’) to denote sub-lexical roots and morphemes; it remains to be seen whether this usage
will become widely-accepted or not.
73
 For an important partial exception to this generalization, see §13.5.

Although it is an incredibly rare case in practice – I have certainly never naturally
attested anything like this – one might conceivably encounter a case in which two
individuated but unidentifiable (and therefore, not case-marked) referents occur in the
same transitive clause, in conditions where it would be pragmatically unknowable which
was more likely to be understood as the relatively more active/agentive. 266 In such a case,

conceivably be taken as weak evidence for a preferred Subject-Object-Verb order;
however, it would be difficult to clearly establish that the interpretation would not in fact
be due to some inferred pragmatic relations – i.e., that the initial noun phrase is more

to be more agentive.

This is not a problem in the case of subject nominalizations, because the subject is either ellipsed or an
unmarked “internal” head, nor in the case of event nominalizations, seemingly because events are not as
easily construed as possessed. The ambiguity may exist in locative/oblique nominalizations, although it has
not been robustly-attested due again to the difficulty of construing many locative/oblique semantic types as
possessed. The prominence of this potential ambiguity among non-subject nominalizations can perhaps then
be explained by the ready ability for non-subject nominalizations to denote concrete, possessible entitities.

This chapter examines the basic constituents and their orders in simple clauses. Simple
clauses, as defined here, are those with a single verb phrase. The verb within the phrase
is finite and constitutes a predication. It may be simple, compound (see §4.1.1 for a
description of compounds), serialized, or complex; the latter having a semantic main
verb, plus nominalizers and auxiliaries (see §5.4 for a description of complex verb
forms). Magar, like all Tibeto-Burman languages (with the exception of Bai and the
Karenic languages1) is an SOV language, it has postpositions rather than prepositions and
genitive and relative clause modifiers precede the modified noun.

A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF TWO MAGAR DIALECTS OF NEPAL:
 TANAHU AND SYANGJA MAGAR
 by
Karen A. Grunow-Harsta
 The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2008
 Under the Supervision of Edith Moravcsik
 ABSTRACT
 The dissertation comprises a detailed grammatical description and comparison of
 two dialects of Magar: Tanahu and Syangja; both are spoken in west-central
 Nepal. Magar is an endangered Himalayish language, belonging to the Bodic
 branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family. The dialects represent two distinct
 branches of Magar: eastern and western. The dissertation is systematic and
 comprehensive in scope. Its purpose is to provide a record of a language for
 which, previously, there has existed no adequate description and for which the
 opportunity to gather data is quickly disappearing. The data presented in the
 dissertation is a record of primary research carried out in Nepal in 1998, 2006 and
 2008.
 The dissertation commences with a demographic and socio-cultural description of
 the Magar people, their history, and the language's state of endangerment; as well
it provides a typological sketch which places Magar into the linguistic context of
the Nepal Himalaya. Chapters two to fourteen document primary data and
analyze it in order to yield the generalizations that govern the language. The
chapters progress from smaller to larger linguistic elements, proceeding from
phonology to morphology to syntax, with chapters thirteen and fourteen analyzing
larger portions of discourse. The dissertation concludes with a selection of texts
from each dialect.
The grammar highlights divergence between the Magar variants, specifically with
respect to their phonological inventories, nominal case-marking systems, and
subject-verb agreement marking as well as valence-marking patterns. This
divergence is discussed in terms of language contact and of Magar's own
historical development.
In the course of the description and analysis, significant features (i.e. those which
relate or distinguish Magar from areally and genetically related languages) are
foregrounded. Among these features are phonation register, dative case-marking
of primary-objects and experiencers, the processes and functions of
in
nominalization, the processes and functions of grammaticalization, and the
expression of evidentiality.
It is intended that the grammar should be of use to scholars in a variety of
subdisciplines of linguistics, including those interested in Kham-Magar
languages, those interested in Himalayish languages, those interested in
comparative Tibeto-Burman, typologists, and those interested in contact
linguistics.

 1 General introduction
 1.1 Goals of the dissertation
The goal of this dissertation is to provide a comprehensive descriptive record of two
dialects of Magar: Tanahu and Syangja (see figure 1.1). Magar is an endangered
language belonging to the Bodic branch of Tibeto-Burman; and is spoken primarily in
Nepal.
Figure 1.1 Map of Nepal districts with Syangja and Tanahu highlighted
 The goal of the grammar is to provide a lasting and accessible record of a
threatened language; one which will be a valuable resource to linguists of diverse
theoretical persuasions.1
1.2Ethnographic and demographic description of the Magar people
The Magars are an indigenous tribe of Nepal. Shepherd describes them as ""a Mongolian
people who had migrated into Nepal in the predawn of history."" (1982:11). He observes
that the origin of the Magar people is not preserved in their lore, ""Many of the ethnic
groups had legends that told how they had come to Nepal from Tibet or some other

than being theory driven; in other words, it espouses no specific theoretical stand-point.
 2
country, but not the Magars. For them at least, history simply began and ended in Nepal""
(1982:11). My own enquires have confirmed this belief; Magars consider themselves to
be autochthonous to Nepal. However, interest in their culture and a need to authenticate
their ethnic identity has led some Magars to create a history and culture for their people;
for example, there are newly-spun fables of their origin2; and a newly created script
called Akkha Lipi3 and numerical system (M.S. Thapa 2002) (see §8.1.1) as well as
numerous neologisms4
That little is known of Magar origins is not surprising given how little is known of
the origins of Tibeto-Burman people and most particularly the language family as a
whole. This paucity of historical certainty is due to a number of factors, among them the
time-depth of Sino-Tibetan, to which Tibeto-Burman belongs, which is estimated at c.
8500 years, as compared to c. 5500 years for Indo-Aryan. Research, both linguistic and
archaeological, is at a pioneering stage. For example, Tibeto-Burman historical
phonology is not fully understood and dates for the few known sound shifts, and major
splits in the Tibeto-Burman tree can only be putatively assigned (van Driem 1999). In
2
The following is an account from Tribal Ethnography of Nepal Volume-II, by Dr. Rajesh Gautam and
Asoke K. Thapa Magar. 'The origin of the Magar of the Bara Magaranth is that in the land known as Seem
there lived a tribe of people. There were two brothers named See Magar and chintoo Magar who began to
have differences thus while one stayed back the other headed south and after a series of migrations reached
the place called Kangwachen. This is in southern Sikkim...whose northern end lived the Bhotia people
while at the bottom or southern end settled these Magar immigrants. As the years passed the Magars
became very powerful and made the northern Bhotia their vassals. At this time the Magar king named
Sintoo Sati Sheng (shang) ruled in a very despotic manner and the northern bhotia conspired and
assassinated him. Later on the queen of this king took revenge and poisoned 1000 Bhotia people at a place
called Tong Song Fong meaning where a thousand were murdered. But later son (sic) the Bhotia won and
so the Magar had to again migrate further south and from there they moved in all directions among which
one froup (sic) migrated to Simraogadh. They are believed to have moved towards the Bara Magarnth area
of Palpa, Gulmi, Dhor, Gherung, etc. one group moved towards the Okhaldhunga region and another group
seems to have returned to the east. No dates are given.'
3
This script is largely the work of M.S. Thapa.
4
An example is the term waRpaRiot 'teacher' a neologism derived from wa/#-/a^'knowledge-seek'. This
term is employed by a very small group of individuals intent on purifying the language. The commonly
used term for teacher is master.
 3
addition, there have been numerous large and ancient population movements (van Driem
 1999, LaPolla 2001), resulting in complex language contact situations (LaPolla 2001),
which have obscured relationships between languages and peoples. Moreover, there are
divergent analyses of core linguistic features resulting in disparate reconstructions of the
Tibeto-Burman languages. Among these disputed features are: verb agreement patterns,
case marking systems and tone. In each case, the issue is whether or not the feature
should be reconstructed for the proto-language. On the one hand, scholars such as
DeLancey (1988, 1989, 1992), van Driem (1990, 1991, 1995 and 1999) and Watters
(2002) regard shared features to be a result of genetic relation; whereas others, such as
Thurgood, (1984) and LaPolla (1992, 1994), regard shared features to be a result of
language contact, diffusion and drift. The result of these factors: time-depth, population
movements and language contact, as well as differing reconstructions, is that the origins
of the people and their proto-languages are unclear and uncertain. As Matisoff observes
(1999:1), ""...even higher-order sub-groupings are up for grabs"".

To recap, verb phrase constructions in Magar can be arranged along a continuum
ranging from simple to complex and from more to less tightly bound, that is, from: single
verbs to compounds to serial verbs to nominalized verbs with auxiliaries; see table 11.1.
All of these, because they express a single event, and do not have more than one fully
semantic verb, have been determined to constitute a single clause as opposed to complex
clauses which include complement-taking and converbal constructions. The latter are
discussed in chapter twelve.

11.1.4 Modification in the verb phrase
Verb phrases, having either simple, compound, or serial stems, can be modified by
adverbs and adverbials. The modifier precedes the verb, as in (12). Thus the verb phrase
may be formalized as VP > (MOD) V, (where V is as described above in §11.1.1-§11.1.3).

11.2 Constituent order in declarative clauses
Declarative clauses in Magar are fairly consistently verb-final; however word order
variations are for reasons of topicalization are not uncommon in Magar.
11.2.1 Basic declarative constituent order
Declarative clauses which are not altered for pragmatic reason are verb-final. Only
particles, for example evidentials, as in (13) (see §13.2) and those functioning as
discourse-markers may follow the verb, such as thikand haido in (14). Discourse
particles are outside the clause and are discussed in § 11.8.

(14) rAksi tAyar chanR-le-sa thik-hai
alcohol ready become-IMPF-INFR okay-okay
'The raksi has become ready, alright, okay.' (D.008bT)
The basic constituent orders are SV (Subject Verb) for intransitive clauses, AOV
(Agent Object Verb) for transitive clauses and AOOV (Agent Object Object Verb) for
389
ditransitives. Causatives allows up to four objects AOO(0)(0)V. Examples of these
clause types follow:

 'Father slept.'
(b) boi-erRa sat-aTransitive clause —*• AOV

'Father made mother make brother-in-law give elder brother a goat.'
11.2.2 Topicalized declarative constituent orders
As noted, word order is affected by topicality. Examples in (16) show right dislocation of
subjects. Example (17) has both a right dislocated subject and left dislocated object. In
each case dislocation is employed to focus, or topicalize a particular argument.

11.3 Transitivity and valence
Transitivity concerns the relationship between the verb and its arguments. Argument
roles, here, are defined, semantico-syntactically. Specifically, they are defined in terms
of A, S and O, where A refers to 'agent', S is the only argument of an intransitive clause
and O is the object (the patient). Arguments which are optional and/or ancilliary to the
verb phrase are 'obliques'. These roles are distinct from grammatical roles. Where
relevant, in this section, grammatical roles of subject and direct and indirect object are
also identified. Valence refers to the number and constellation of arguments in a clause.
This section describes transitivity patterns, the structure of intransitive, transitive,
391
ditransitive clauses, benefactives and malefactives and those which change valence such
as causatives and resultatives.
 11.3.1 Transitivity patterns
Cross-linguistically, patterns of marking verb-argument relations in clauses generally
follow either a nominative/accusative pattern, in which the A and S align, or an
ergative/accusative pattern, in which S and P align. Magar exhibits both patterns in
different contexts.
",1,SOV,"Based on the information provided in the descriptive grammar, the language described has a dominant word order of ""SOV"" (Subject-Object-Verb) in declarative clauses.",SOV,0,0,
Magar," In Syangja dialect, pronominal agreement with the subject of intransitive clauses is
indexed on the verb in first and second person as in (22a-c). In Tanahu, verb agreement
is not encoded in any person as in (23a-c).

11.3.3 Transitive clauses
Transitive clauses are those with a transitive verb, including those with vestigal
transitivity finals -t and -£((26)) (see §4.2.1), and at least two arguments: A and O
(subject and patient) in that order. Agents, like the S-argument of an intransitive clause,
exhibit the qualities of subjects: they are clause-initial and topical. In Syangja dialect,
agents are consistently ergative ((24)). In Tanahu, agents are in ergative case in the
perfective aspect only ((25)). The patient is in absolutive case unless it is a primary
object, one which is high on the animancy hierarchy; these argumenrs are in dative case.
Primary object marking is discussed in §3.4.1.5.1.

As noted, objects are not indexed on the verb in either Magar dialect; thus there is no
difference in the agreement morphology between intransitive and transitive verbs, as seen
in the contrasts in (26).

11.3.4 Ditransitive clauses
A ditransitive clause has three arguments: an agent, a patient and a recipient (a subject
and two objects). In these clauses, the agent is in ergative case, the patient is in the
unmarked absolutive case and the recipient (a benefactor or malefactor) is in the dative
case. Prototypically ditransitive clauses are formed with verbs such as ja/;'give' ((27)),
kas 'feed' ((28)), de ~ te 'tell' ((29)) and ka 'put' ((30)).

'And the frog, well, having been put in a bottle was kept (there). (A.A. 003T)
As seen above, the unmarked constituent order is: Agent + Recipient + Patient. The
order iconically underscores the higher status on the animacy hierarchy of the recipient,
which precedes the patient. If both objects are equally high on the animacy scale; for
example two humans, both will generally not be dative marked. The recipient will still
precede the patient, as in (31), but will be in a locative case.

11.3.5 Benefactives and malefactives
The verb yaRgive is used to form benefactives (32) and malefactives (33). In these
constructions, the benefit or harm is a noun or nominalization with -mA. The verb ya/iis
clause-final and finite. The benefactor is in ergative case and precedes the beneficiary,
who/which is in dative case. Unlike its meaning in ditransitives, in benefactives and
malefactives, the verb yaR has a grammaticalized meaning and auxiliary function as in
(33c) wherein the owl does not literally snap off the crow's wings and then give them to
him, the wings are snapped off to his detriment. LaPolla (2003:33) has observed a
parallel grammaticalized use of the verb 'give' in the following languages: Jingphaw (tfa),
Tamang (pin), Tsamgla (bi), Camling (bi), Belhare (per), Lahu (pi).

 11.3.7 Causative clauses
The clauses treated in this chapter express single events. Semantically causatives may be
regarded as involving at two events: that performed by the causer and that performed by
the causee. Nonetheless, the causative is described in this chapter because in Magar
causation is morphological; i.e. the two events are expressed with a single finite verb (see
also §4.3.1 for a discussion of causative morphology).

1.2 .3 Classificação da língua dos povos Timbira
Uma língua pode ser definida como um sistema de categorização do mundo,
segundo a teoria dos signos (Fiorin, 2002). Ou seja, as línguas não são nomenclaturas que
se aplicam a uma realidade pré-ordenada, mas são modos de interpretar o mundo. No
entanto, para o que vai nos interessar nesse momento, o melhor conceito de língua é o que
abrange o sistema, que é de domínio de todos os falantes de uma mesma língua, e suas
variantes. Em outras palavras, as variantes dialetais de uma mesma língua precisam
compartilhar (em sua forma e função), as categorias gramaticais, tais como as categorias de
pessoa, número, gênero, caso, tempo, aspecto, modo ou modalidade etc.

Sentences basically have the SOV type of word-order. The predicate, usually placed on the
sentence-final position,can make a full sentence even by itself. The following is not so much
a formal syntactic analysis as a rough illustration of Solon sentences with minimum practical
classification. M ost of the sentences are derived from Hu & Chaoke 1986 (abbreviated as HC
below), Chaoke 1995 (abbr. C), and Chaoke, Tsumagari & Kazama 1991 (abbr. CTK).

Another widely used Mongolian word is yeeme either as an expletive noun ʻ thingʼor a sentence-
final particle (25). Since many M ongolian words have their counterparts in Dagur, which is
another influential M ongolic language among Solon people,it is often difficult to decide which
the direct source of borrowing is. Such words as xaxraa ʻ chickenʼand dusee ʻ wallʼmay safely
be attributed to Dagur.

The nominative form and the other case forms can be followed byone of the following personal

 -t(i) (INCL)
 2nd -s(i) (〜C-ci) -sun〜-sun (〜C-cun〜-cun)
 3rd -nin(i)［-ni］(the same as SG)
 Reflexive［-bi〜-wi］ ［-beli〜-weli］
 The forms in square brackets are for oblique cases. The reflexive forms,meaning ʻ oneʼs
/
ownʼ(SG or PL),indicate that the possessor(s)is are the same with the subject of the sentence.
In the reflexive paradigm,the unmarked (nominative)form with the reflexive ending functions
as a direct object,not as a subject. The same is the case with the 1S oblique ending:the form
in -beye〜-weye without any case marking is employed as a direct object. The third person
accusative takes the form of -waa-ni〜-wee-ni etc. Note that the third person usually has no
distinction in number both in nominal and verbal morphology.

discussed in 16.3.
5.10Summary: word classes in Skou
In this chapter we have seen that there are morphological and syntactic reasons to establish
different word classes in Skou, and that these reasons do not need to appeal to any universalist
tendencies observed in other languages, but are based on language-internal evidence. In
addition to the (cross-lingusitically widely attested) open classes of noun, verb and adjective,
and various subdivisions within the first two of these, there are also a range of smaller, less
productive word classes. Adverbs are a small class, but whether they are better thought of as
being a small, but open class, or a small closed class of words is a moot point.

Skou,"Because topicality is inherently associated with given information, such NPs are often
marked with demonstratives, and so these, and the restrictions on their use, are also described
in this chapter.
4.1Parameters of pragmatic variation
In addition to the basic sentence structures shown in the previous chapter, pragmatic factors
often cause the sentence to appear in a different arrangement. This was mentioned briefly in
3.1, where the effects of topicalisation on the structure of the clause were described. There are
three parameters under which the order and morphological coding of elements in a clause can
show variation. These are:
•word order variation
•variation in syntactic status
• explicit marking for pragmatic force
The first two of these parameters will be discussed in detail throughout this chapter. The last
parameter, explicit marking for pragmatic force, is tied in to the system of deictic reference, and
will be discussed in 4.7.
4.2Variation in word order: topicality and contrast
As discussed earlier in 3.1, there is a very strict configurationality requirement on clauses in
Skou that they must follow an SOV word order; different oblique arguments may appear in
different positions in the clause, with instruments optionally preverbal and marked for function,
and all possibly postverbal, morphologically marked and unmarked depending on semantic role
and function. The evidence for a VP constituent is strong.
",1,SOV,The language described in the grammar has a dominant SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order.,SOV,0,0,
Skou,"This same inverted-coding strategy is employed in many languages of New Guinea,
including Skou. One simple example is shown in (76). Here we can see that, assuming that the
normal SOV word order is exemplified here as well as elsewhere, oe ‘burp’ is the subject of the
sentence, and pe ‘she/her’ is the object. Apparently confirming this hypothesis, the verb shows
agreement for a third person non-feminine argument, not the third person feminine argument
that represents the burper. From the clause-internal evidence, then, the subject of this clause is
unambiguously the inanimate burp, oe. 38

 burp 3SG. F 3SG. NF=burp
 ‘She burped.’
 (Literally, ‘(A) burp burped her.’)
(77) * oe pe pe=láng, * pe oe (pe=/ke=)láng
This coding strategy is similar to that found in many New Guinean or western European
languages, such as can be seen in the following Dutch sentence. Here again the experiencer is
coded in the position normally reserved for objects of transitive clauses, and the effector
appears preverbally, and apparently with subject agreement on the verb.

3 Grammar outline
As discussed in the introduction (especially sections 1.5 and 1.8), many features of Skou are
not typical of what is generally thought to be a ‘typical’ Papuan language.29 On the other hand,
there are many areal traits of the New Guinea region that are instantiated in Skou, and these,
along with some of the exceptions, will be briefly mentioned in this chapter. This chapter is
intended as a ‘road map’ of the contents of the rest of the book. It provides directions to where
more details on a given topic may be found, and, along with 1.5, it serves as a typological ‘pit
stop’, in the sense that a more complete inventory of the more salient and cross-linguistically
comparable typological features that are not found in Skou is presented here than in the rest of
the book. Elsewhere the emphasis is describing the structures that the language does possess.
3.1 Word Order
Skou displays a basic SOV word order, typical of many Papuan languages. Examples of this
can be seen in the examples (1), (3) and (5). The first sentence shows the normal order with
subject preceding object, and the clause ending in a verb (the justification for the labels ‘subject’
and ‘object’ is given at the end of this chapter). The ungrammaticality of these nominals
appearing in the reverse order is shown in (2). (Topicalisation can change the apparent word
order in sentences, though the word order inside the clause is still intact. See 3.1.1, and chapter
4, for more discussion of this construction, and Donohue 2005 for discussion of the
construction in an areal perspective.) The appropriate sentences with the participants reversed in
terms of syntactic roles are shown in (3) and (4).30
(1)[A Áì][P yá-né-nì=ne]ke=yú-yú.
fathersister-1SG. DAT-1SG. GEN=1SG. DAT 3SG. NF=search-RED
 ‘Father is looking for my sister.’
(2) * [P yá ne nì ne] [A áì] ke yú-yú
(3) [A Yá-né-nì=ne][A áì] pe=yú-yú.
 sister-1SG. DAT-1SG. GEN=1SG. DATfather3SG. F =search-RED
‘My sister is looking for father.’
29Assuming that a non-Papuanist does think about what a Papuan languages is like, they usually
mention features of highlands Trans New Guinea languages, in my experience. See 1.5 for
discussion.
30 The high tone on the first dative morpheme marking yá ‘sister’ is present as a result of tone
spreading from the high-toned root, yá, to the toneless suffix that is part of the same
phonological word as it. The genitive suffix projects its own phonological word, and so
realises its own tone pattern independently of the tone pattern of the nominal root to which it
is syntactically bound (see 2.3.1).
",1,SOV,The language described in the grammar has a dominant SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order.,SOV,0,0,
Skou," Tone is present at the word level, but syllable-level constraints apply to limit the realisation
of certain tonal contours on monosyllabic words. Five word tones (phonetically H, L, HL, LH,
and LHL) are thus realised on monosyllabic words as [–], [–] and [\], with the rising and the
rise-fall pitch contours not found on single syllables. This is described in detail in 2.3.1. The
HL melody shows additional contrasts depending on the placement of an accent, which results
in the prelinking of the tonal units to the designated syllable.
1.8.4 Morphological profile
There is evidence of Skou having been a language at the isolating end of the spectrum, with
little derivational or inflectional morphology, but has recently moved to a more inflecting
system, with considerable head marking of both pronominal agreement and, on verbs, aspect,
and also a developing case system. The most developed morphology is that on verbs, where
subject agreement is more than just universal, and vestiges of an object inflection can be found
Skou31
in some verbs. Applicatives are the sole valency-increasing mechanism in the language, and
there is an apparent passive construction in the language, unusual for its area.
1.8.5 Syntactic patterns
Skou has OV and SV patterns (Dryer 1991). When, rarely, both nominal positions are filled,
this is typically realised as a clause with SOV order (see 3.1). Skou shows most of the
typological profile that can be expected for a language in the New Guinea part of the world,
including head-initial noun phrases. The tables in 1.5 have already shown much of this basic
information when comparing Skou with Foley’s ‘generic New Guinea’ profile.

Lisu," Gerner (2008) also discusses an equivalent word in Yongren Lolo, thie21. He
labels it as an ambiquity-driven differential object marker. He states that the
morphological marker thie21 is obligatory if and only if the roles of A (agent) and O
(object) or B (oblique) “cannot be unambiguously retrieved from the semantics of the
verb” (Gerner 2008:324). He says that
 Yongren Lolo is…a kind of language which mobilizes grammatical devices only
 when universal semantic principles fail to assign participant roles. For a huge
 chunk of clauses, Lolo does not mark anything, either by morphology or by word
 order. When an ambiguity arises, Lolo opens first the morphological toolbox and
 then, in case that ambiguity persists, a second toolbox of word-order hierarchies
 (Gerner 2008:329).
It cannot be said, however, that the Lolo leil ‘DOM’ is obligatory if and only if the roles
of A and O or B are ambiguous, as it is applied to all human direct objects.

TB languages place genitive modifiers before the possessed noun, relative clauses before
the head noun, and postpositional phrases before the verb. He has also observed that TB
languages employ auxiliary verbs after main verbs and clause-final markers for

LaPolla states that in Qiang “The order of the NPs in the clause is affected by pragmatic factors. Utterance-

distinguished from each other by means of position. The default order is for the subject
to precede the object. (OS order is also possible, but not near as common). The subject
usually is animate; the object more likely is not, as in (214). Sometimes subjects and
objects can be distinguished from each other by case marking. When the object is a
human, it is marked with the postposition leil ‘DOM’ to differentiate it from the subject
as in (215). Animate non-human objects can also optionally take the postposition leil
‘DOM’.

 Matisoff (2003) discusses an equivalent word in Lahu, tha ‘upper surface/top
part’. He refers to it as a noun particle and says that it acts as an object marker in Lahu.
He explains that the word originally meant ‘ascend/above’. He states that in its function
as an object marker “…it is used sparingly, only where clarity demands or emphasis is
required. When both direct and indirect objects are present, tha will follow the indirect
object. This is because indirect objects are typically human, so that an explicit marker is
sometimes required to exclude an agentive interpretation” (Matisoff 2003:215). The Lolo
leil ‘DOM’, however, is not used sparingly, and it is not applied only when clarity is
required.

Summary of Grammatical Terms
adjective In English adjectives are descriptive words that modify nouns but in Oneida
adjectives are a type of verb. See the summary of adjectives page 128.
affix Prefixes and suffixes collectively are known as affixes. They are attachments to
verb roots and stems.
alienable possession The objects of possession come in two sorts, those that can be
given away such as cars and tools and those that cannot such as legs and necks.
Different pronominal prefixes are used for each type. Alienable possession is the term
for objects that can be given away.
aorist This is one of the prepronominal prefixes. In form it is usually wa÷- although it
has quite a few other forms when it combines with other prepronominal prefixes. Its
most usual meaning is simple past tense, but there are exceptions with certain verb
stems. It can only be used when the verb has a punctual aspect suffix.
aspect suffix Every Oneida verb ends with one of four possible suffixes that indicate
the type of action involved. The four suffixes are serial, punctual, imperative, and
perfective.
a-stem Any verb stem that begins with -a- before pronominal prefixes are attached.
causative A derivational suffix added to verb stems that creates new verb stems with
the additional meaning of causing or making something happen. Its form is identical
to the instrumental suffix.
cislocative This is one of the prepronominal prefixes. Its usual form is -t-. It is most
often used to indicate the location of an action. If the verb stem implies motion, then
the cislocative suggest the motion is towards the speaker. But it has other uses as
well.
coincident This is one of the prepronominal prefixes. Its form is ts- and its meaning
involves some notion of sameness.
comparative A form of the adjective with either the suffix -er or the additional word
more. The meaning of the comparative in Oneida is expressed by the particle s§ha.
context form The pronunciation of a word that does not occur at the end of a
sentence is its context form. This form does not have any whispered parts.
continuative A derivational suffix usually containing a -k- that expresses a number
of meaning modification of a verb. See page 112.
 140
contrastive This is one of the prepronominal prefixes. Its form is th- and its meaning
involves some notion of difference or unusualness. It sometimes is used as the
negative.
c-stem Any verb or noun stem that begins with a consonant.
dative This is a derivational suffix. Among its forms are -hs-, -<-, and -<ni-. Its
function is often to make a transitive verb out of an intransitive one, usually with the
meaning of doing something on behalf of or for someone else.
derivation The prefixes and suffixes that alter the meaning of a stem in sometimes
unpredictable ways, or that sometimes occur and sometimes do not, are derivations of
that stem. Derivations are patterned but less regular than inflections.
derivational suffix After the main verb root and before the aspect suffix a number of
derivational suffixes can be added to modify the meaning of the stem in partly
predictable ways. There are about half a dozen such suffixes. Among them are:
instrumental, distributive, dative, and causative.
dislocative This is a derivational suffix that addes the meaning of going to to the
verb. It is also used with a particular aspect suffix to express intention.
distributive This is one of the derivational suffixes. Among its many forms are -nyu-
and -u-. It adds some kind of severalness to the action of the verb: several
participants, several times, several places, several ways.
dual This is one of the grammatical numbers and means exactly two. It applies to
pronouns and pronominal prefixes.
dualic This is one of the prepronominal prefixes. Its usual form is either -t- or -te-
like the cislocative but because of the way it combines with other prefixes, it can
always be distinguished from the cislocative. Many stems require this prefix with no
special addition to the meaning. Sometimes it adds the meaning of two.
dummy root Many verb roots that are used most typically with incorporated nouns
can be used in a generic sense as well. In such cases a dummy noun root (with each
verb root having its own specific dummy root) is used.
epenthesis A sound process of adding additional sounds into a word. In Oneida when
assembling parts of a word would otherwise create a cluster of consonants that would
not be pronouncable in Oneida.
epenthetic vowel The vowel -e- is used to break up impossible clusters of
consonants. It adds no additional meaning.
 141
e-stem Any stem beginning with either -e- or -<- before pronominal prefixes are
attached.
exclusive This refers to a kind of plural we that excludes the person spoken to, a
we that means me and them but not you.
extender A suffix (often -hsl- or -tsl-) that is attached to noun roots when they are
used in more complex stems. It adds no additional meaning. Since each noun root has
a preferred extender (many noun roots require none at all), the extender can be
thought of as an extension of the noun root itself.
factual An alternative name for the aorist prefix.
feminine indefinite One of the two feminine genders in Oneida. See page 91. It is
called indefinite because it is used whenever the gender is unknown.
feminine zoic One of the two feminine genders in Oneida. See page 91. This one is
also used for most animals.
first person The grammatical term for pronouns that include the person speaking,
such as I, me, we, or us.
full reflexive A grammatical prefix that attaches to the beginning of verb stems. Its
form is -atat(e)- and it adds the meaning of doing the action on oneself.
future tense One of the prepronominal prefixes that indicates future time. Its form is
consistently -<- and it is only used on verbs that have punctual aspect suffixes.
habitual Any verb form that has the meaning of an action being done routinely or
extended over time whether past, present, or future is called habitual. It is the
opposite of punctual and both punctual and habitual are known as grammatical
aspects.
imperative Imperatives are commands.
inalienable possession The objects of possession come in two sorts, those that can be
given away such as cars and tools and those that cannot such as legs and necks.
Different pronominal prefixes are used for each type. Inalienable possession is the
term for objects that cannot be given away, primarily parts of the body.
inchoative This is a derivational suffix. It attaches to verb stems that mean states or
conditions and it adds the meaning of getting into that state or condition.
inclusive This term is used for pronouns or pronominal prefixes that include both the
speaker and the listener, a kind of we or us.
 142
incorporated noun Oneida verb stems can be quite complex and some contain noun
roots within the verb stem itself. If a noun root is not a separate word but part of a
complex verb, then it is called incorporated.
indefinite tense One of the three tense prefixes, its most typically form is -a- and its
meaning is either a mild kind of obligation (should, ought) or it is used to indicate
various kinds of subordination in a sentence. For example, it is used on verbs after
the verb want to indicate what action is wanted.
inflection This is a class of prefixes or suffixes noted for their regularity and
predictaility of meaning. In English nouns are inflected for number and verbs are
inflected for tense. In Oneida verbs are typically inflected for aspect.
instrumental This is part of a complex verb stem. It is a derivational suffix added to
a verb root to give the extra meaning of using something to do the action or doing
the action with something (typically a tool but sometimes a place).
isolation form The form of pronunciation used when a word is spoken alone or at
the end of a sentence. It often involves some whispering or alternation from the
context form. Although their pronunciations may be different, their meanings are the
same.
i-stem Any noun or verb stem that begins with -i-.
iterative This is one of the prepronominal prefixes. Its usual form is -s- and it adds
several meanings such as again, back, or one.
lexicalization The process of a composed expression acting as a single integrated word
(lexical item). The process usually involves some unpredicted specialization in
meaning. The components in kaw<naye=n@s predict it means it catches words, but it
actually has become lexicalized to mean just tape recorder.
locative This refers to location. There are two locative prepronominal prefixes:
cislocative and translocative.
masculine The grammatical term for pronouns and pronominal prefixes that indicate
males.
negative The grammatical term for any particles and prefixes that express negation.
There is one prefix that used most typically and it is known as the negative prefix
te(÷)-.
nominalizer A suffix (often -hsl- or -tsl-) that is attached to verb roots when they are
used as noun stems in more complex stems.
 143
noun In English nouns are identified by their form (the kinds of suffixes, such as
plural, they can have) and by their role (such as subject) in a sentence. In Oneida
nouns can be identified by their forms (words built from noun roots with noun
affixes) or by their uses so that even words constructed as verbs can be used as
nouns.
number The grammatical category for singluar, dual, and plural. It is a feature of
pronoun prefixes.
objective This is the name for a class of intransitive pronoun prefixes on verbs. It is
the opposite of subjective, which is the other class. Learning verbs in Oneida involves
learning whether they are in the objective or subjective class and in general it cannot
be predicted from the English translation.
orientation verb This is a verb root expressing a physical orientation such as
standing, lying, stuck on the end of, or attached to. They are often used with
incorporated noun roots to indicate whether the noun is in its expected orientation or
not.
o-stem Any stem that begins with -o- or -u- before pronoun prefixes are attached.
particle This term is used in Oneida for any word that is neither a noun or a verb.
They are usually one or two syllables and cannot be broken down into parts. They
are used to express all sorts of syntactic and discourse meanings.
participle In English participles are verbs turned into adjectives such as falling leaves
(present participle) or fallen leaves (past participle). Oneida has no specific participles.
Such meanings are conveyed by the different aspects of the verb.
partitive This is one of the eleven pre-pronominal prefixes. Its form always includes
an n and it has a variety of meanings in counting and questions as well as being
required by some particular verb stems.
past perfective This is one of the ways of indicating past time. It is a form -hne
suffixed to the end of a verb with a perfective suffix already on it
past serial This is another way of indicating past time. Its form -(h)kwe is attached
to verbs ending in a serial suffix.
past tense There is not a single way to indicate past time in Oneida. Different verbs
use different devices, sometimes prefixes such as the aorist, and sometimes suffixes.
perfective aspect This is a verb suffix that takes the action of the verb as a state,
either the state of doing the action right now or the state of have complete the action.
It is also called the stative aspect.
 144
person Grammatical person is a feature of pronouns or pronoun prefixes. The first
person indicates the one(s) speaking; the second person is whomever is spoken to; and
the third person is whomever is spoken about. I is a first person pronoun; you is a
second person pronoun; and they is a third person pronoun.
plural In English plural is the grammatical number for anything that is not singular,
but in Oneida there is a dual number for two of anything so plural is for three or
more of anything.
possessive Both English and Oneida have multiple ways of expressing possession,
sometimes with verbs such as have and own, and sometimes with sets of special
pronoun prefixes.
predicate Most sentences consist of identifying some object or individual and making
a claim about that object or individual. The predicate is the part that makes the claim.
It can be very simple such as the verb laughed or it can be more complex such as
washed clothes over and over for someone else. In Oneida verb stems, either simple
or complex, are the predicates.
prefix Any attachment of identifiable form or meaning to the front of a root or stem.
Most Oneida stems need prefixes to make them complete words.
preposition In English these are small words such as in, on, under, of, with that
express spatial and grammatical meanings with nouns. Oneida does not have a
separate class of words that correspond to prepositions. Instead their meanings are
folded into various suffixes and verb stems.
prepronominal prefix Any of the eleven prefixes that are used in front of the
pronoun prefixes on Oneida verbs. Each has its own form, meaning, and ability to
combine with others. They modify the meaning of the verb with reference to
time,place, and a number of other adverbial meanings.
productivity How frequently or widely a particular grammatical pattern or process
applies.
progressive A verb suffix that indicates ongoing action or action while one is in
motion.
pronominal prefix A prefix required on any verb stem to provide information about
who is doing or receiving the action of the verb. These prefixes fall into different
classes and subclasses depending on the verb they attach to and include information
about the number and gender of the particpants in the verb's activity.
 145
punctual aspect This is a suffix on verb stems that indicates the verb's activity is
being seen as happening at a single point, as opposed to being ongoing or completed.
Whenever the punctual aspect suffix is used, one other three tense prefixes (aorist,
future, or indefinite) must also be used.
purposive This is an aspect suffix that adds the meaning of intention to the verb.
reflexive This is a derivational prefix that is added to verb stems. It is always at the
front of stems that the pronoun prefixes attach to. There are several modifications it
adds to the meaning of the verb, many involving reflecting the action back somehow
on the actor. The particular meaning modification has to be learned for each verb
stem.
root A root is not a whole word. It is a building block to which various prefixes
and suffixes and possibly other roots are added. There are both noun and verb roots.
Roots cannot typically be separated into smaller components.
root suffix There are several of these suffixes such as causative, dative, distributive,
and instrumental that attach to verb roots and add specific meaning modifications to
them. The root with its attached suffix then becomes a verb stem.
second person Pronoun forms that refer to you are called second person. Unlike
English, Oneida has different forms depending on how many individuals are meant by
you.
semi-reflexive One of the two reflexive prefixes that attach to verb stems. It is the
shorter form and its meaning is more variable than the other one - the full reflexive.
serial aspect This is a suffix on verb stems that indicates either habitual or current
activity of the verb.
singular One of the grammatical numbers, as opposed to dual and plural in Oneida.
stative Any predicate that describes a state or condition is a stative. It is the opposite
of an action, although the result of an action can be described as a state. Stative is
also an alternative name for the perfective aspect.
stem This is the form of a verb that contains at least a verb root and maybe several
derivational affixes to which pronoun prefixes and aspect suffixes are attached to make
a complete word. The verb stem expresses a predicate.
stem class Verb stems falls into several classes depending on the sound they begin
with. This is important in determining which set of pronoun prefixes must be attached
to the verb stem.
 146
stem joiner When an incorporated noun and a verb stem are joined together in a
complex verb stem they are often separated by the vowel -a-. This vowel is necessary
but adds no additional meaning. It simply joins the noun and verb stems together.
subjective This is the name for a class of intransitive pronoun prefixes on verbs. It
is the opposite of objective, which is the other class. Learning verbs in Oneida
involves learning whether they are in the objective or subjective class and in general
it cannot be predicted from the English translation
suffix Any attachment of identifiable form or meaning to the end of a root or stem.
Most Oneida stems need suffixes to make them complete words.
superlative The form of adjectives characterized by the suffix -est or the adverb
most. In Oneida the superlative is indicated by a particle and a prefix.
third person This is a characteristic of pronouns or pronoun prefixes involving neither
the speaker nor the one spoken to. Pronouns such as he, she, and they are third
person.
transitive Transitive verbs indicate both a doer and a receiver of the action of the
verb. Intransitive verbs indicate just the individual(s) doing the action or being in a
state. In English transitive verbs are those that have a direct object and in general
those correspond to transitive verbs in Oneida but not always. In Oneida transitive
verbs are defined by the class of pronoun prefix the verb stem requires. There are
also a number of derivational suffixes in Oneida (as there are in English) that change
intransitive verbs into transitive ones.
translocative This is one of the prepronominal prefixes on verbs that indicates
direction or sometimes location. It is an optional addition on many verbs but required
on some.

Oneida,"76
The cislocative is easy to confuse with the dualic if you don't pay close attention to the
order of sounds. There are times, however, when it is impossible to tell from a single
word. The phrase where do you live? from the sample vocabulary is:
 kátsa÷ nu tesnákehle
Kátsa÷ nu means where so tesnákehle is the verb meaning you live. The -s- is the
pronoun prefix for you. What is the prefix te-? Is it a dualic prefix implying this verb
requires a dualic prefix? Or is it the cislocative prefix with an epenthetic -e- signifying
you live there? From that one word it is impossible to tell. But if you know the phrase
for where does he live?, which is:
 kátsa÷ nu thanákehle
then you can reason that -ha- is the pronoun prefix for he so the t- must be a cislocative
prefix, not a dualic prefix which would have been te-. This kind of reasoning by
comparing forms is typically necessary when you learn new vocabulary from a native
speaker.
The cislocative is often used with nounsthat have orientational verbs on them. Particles
are usually used as well.
 tsi÷ thonúhsote at his house
 tsi÷ tyakonúhsote at her house
 tsi÷ tkana=táy< at the settlement, in town
 oh<=tú tsi÷ tkanúhsotein front of the house
 oh<=tú tsi÷ tkanyata=láy< in front of the lake
 ohná=k< tsi÷ tkanúhsote behind the house
 ohná=k< tsi÷ tkalu=tóte behind the tree
Sometimes the cislocative can create idiomatic phrases:
cislocative t + pronoun ho + verb aht<ty + perfective < = thoht§ty<
where he has set out from = his house
(Note: the isolation form of this word is thoht§ti.)
Here are some verbs that are used with a cislocative prefix:
-atilut-pull (serial -ha÷; punctual -<; perfective -÷)
 thatilútha÷ he's pulling it
 tayutilu=t§ she pulled it
 twakati=lúte÷ I have pulled it
 (Note: this verb is also used with a dualic prefix instead of the cislocative.

Part IIIThe Basic Noun
NOUNS
Oneida has several types of nouns.
One type is the whole word noun. It is not made up of stems, prefixes, and suffixes but
exists simply as a whole word itself. There are, however, very few nouns in this class.
Examples are é=lhal dog and takós cat and k%skos pig.
A second type of noun is built from a noun stem. Just as with the verbs, noun stems can
be identified by their beginning sound. A-stems typically have no prefix but may have a
suffix. Consonant stems typically have either a ka- or an o- prefix plus some suffix.
These prefixes and suffixes do not add to the meaning of the noun but they are required
in order to turn the stem into a word. Some examples:
 stemwordEnglish
-n<st- o=n§ste corn
-÷sleht- ká=slehtcar, vehicle
-n<y-on<=y@stone
-(u)hw<tsy-ohw§tsyaearth
-w<n-ow<=náword, sound, voice
-ahta- áhtashoe
-at<na÷tsl-at<ná=tsehlilunch, groceries
The particular choice of prefix and suffix is not predictable just by knowing the stem and
meaning. It is something that has to be learned for each word.
The third type of noun is actually a word constructed as a verb and used as a noun. The
verb often is a description of the noun. Examples:
shukwaya÷tísuhe has made us = the creator
kaw<naye=nás it word-catches = tape recorder
iy§haI am parent to him = my son
tyoh<=tú one who leads = the boss
yakolihuny<=níhe she makes the tradition for them = teacher
sk<hnáks<it has bad skin = fox
lotl$hutethe idea comes off of him = (he is) an official
kan&hsotethe house is standing = house
on<yote>a=k@=people of the standing stone = Oneidas
 28
NOUNS IN SIMPLE SENTENCES
Oneida has a word for this - ka÷i=k§ - and a word for that - thi=k§ - but there is no
word for to be (am, is, are, was, were). Simple identification questions are:
 náhte÷ ka÷i=k§what is this?
 náhte÷ thi=k§ what is that?
náhte÷ is the word for what. The particle né= can also be used in identification questions.
It has about the same meaning:
 náhte÷ né= ka÷i=k§what is this?
 náhte÷ né= thi=k§ what is that?
Answers to identification questions can take the following forms:
 ká=sleht ka÷i=k§this is a car
 ká=sleht né= ka÷i=k§this is a car
 né= né= ka÷i=k§ ká=slehtwhat this is is a car
Yes-no questions with a noun take the following forms:
 ká=sleht k< is it a car?
 ká=sleht k< thi=k§is that a car?
 né= k< thi=k§ ká=slehtis that a car?
THE VERB WANT
The common forms of the verb want, one of the few e-stems, are presented here. Note
the rhythm shifts.
 i=kélheI want yaht#=kelheI don’t want
 íhselheyou want yaht#hselheyou don’t want
 í=lelhehe wants yaht#=lelhehe doesn’t want
 i=y§lheshe wantsyaht#=y<lheshe doesn’t want
 l<=nélhe they wantyahteh<=n#lhethey don’t want
This is a good verb to use with nouns:
 íhselhe÷ k< ká=slehtdo you want a car?
 §=<, i=kélhe÷ ká=slehtyes, I want a car
 i=y§lhe÷ k< Wali ká=sleht does Mary want a car?
 náhte÷ í=lelhewhat does he want?
 úhka÷ náhte÷ i=y§lhe÷ ká=slehtwho wants a car?

Oneida," Transitive Pronoun Prefixes
Some verb stems require transitive pronoun prefixes. These prefixes include a pronoun
both for the doer of the verb action and for the receiver of the action. Consider the
following examples from the vocabulary sample.
 kunolúhkwaku- is the pronoun prefix in which I is the doer and you is
 the receiver
 I love you
 shukwaya÷tísu shukwa- is the prefix in which he is the doer and us is the
 receiver
 he has created us = the creator
 shehlo=lí she- is the prefix in which you is the doer and her or them
 is the receiver
 (you) tell her or (you) tell them (In English commands the
 subject you is understood, but in Oneida it is always
 expressed in the prefix.)
 hetshlo=líhets- is the prefix in which you is the doer and him is the
 receiver
 (you) tell him!
 <skya÷takénha÷ k< -sk- is the pronoun prefix in which you is the doer and me is
 the receiver. (The <- at the beginning is a prepronominal
 prefix that marks future tense.)
 will you help me?
A summary of some transitive pronoun prefixesso far:
 sk- you to me ku- I to you
 she-you to her or themkhe- I to her or them
 hets- you to himi-I to him
 shukwa- he to us
These prefixes can be attached to various compatible stems to create words such as the
following:
 sknolúhkwayou love me
 shenolúhkwa you love her / you love them
 hetsnolúhkwayou love him
 shukwanolúhkwahe loves us
 20
 khenolúhkwa I love her / I love them
 inolúhkwa I love him
Most terms for relatives in Oneida are transitive verbs. So, from the vocabulary sample:
 iy§hai- is the prefix (see above) and the verb stem means be a parent to
iy§ha means I am a parent to him = my son
 khey§hakhe- is the prefix and the verb stem means be a parent to
khey§ha means I am a parent to her = my daughter or
 I am a parent to them = my children
 aksóthaak- is the prefix in which she is the doer and me is the receiver
aksótha means she is grandparent to me = my grandmother
 laksótha lak- is the prefix in which he is the the doer and me is the
receiver
laksótha means he is grandparent to me = my grandfather
Some other examples of transitive pronoun prefixes:
 <hetsya÷takénha÷ k< will you help him?
 <shukwaya÷takénha÷ k< will he help us?
 skya÷tísu you have made me
 shey§ha your children or your daughter
 shukway§haour father
Subjective and objective pronoun prefixes
When a verb stem does not require a transitive prefix (typically when there is not both a
doer and a receiver), then the stem requires either the subjective set of pronoun prefixes
or the objective set. The difference between them is a matter of selection more than
meaning and it is not predictable from knowing the meaning of the stem. Nothing
obvious you know about English will help you predict whether an Oneida verb stem will
take subjective or objective prefixes. From the vocabulary sample the verb know and the
verb be happy both require objective prefixes. Here is a collection of several objective
prefixes:
 Objective pronoun prefixes:
 wak- I
 sa-you
 lo-he
 yako-she, or someone
21
And here are some examples of how they attach to verb stems:
 wakanúhte I know
 sanúhte you know
 lonúhte he knows
 yakonúhte she knows
 wakatunháhehleI am happy
 satunháhehleyou are happy
 lotunháhehlehe is happy
 yakotunháhehleshe is happy
The verb like requires subjective prefixes such as the following:
Subjective pronoun prefixes:
 k- I
 s- you
 la-he
 ye-she, or someone
 knú=wehse I like it
 snú=wehse you like it
 lanú=wehsehe likes it
 yenú=wehseshe likes it or someone likes it
The verb like can also be used with transitive prefixes as in the following:
 kun&=wehseI like you
 skn&=wehseyou like me
 in&=wehse I like him
 shukwan&=wehsehe likes us
 22
SIMPLE SENTENCES
Statements
A verb can function as a complete sentence or additional identifications of the pronoun
prefixes can be added:
 lotunháhehle he is happy
 Amos lotunh@hehleAmos is happy
 Wali yakotunháhehleMary is happy
 hetshlo=lí Amostell Amos
 shehlo=lí Wali tell Mary
 iy§ha lotunháhehle my son is happy
 khey§ha yakotunháhehle my daughter is happy
Notice that the pronoun prefixes must always be used even when a name is used as well.
Notice also that the pronoun prefix must agree with the subject in gender (as well as
number and person). The order of words in Oneida expresses emphasis more than
grammatical relations, so the following are also possible:
 lotunháhele÷ Amos Amos is happy
 yakotunháhele÷ Wali Mary is happy
 lotunháhele÷ iy§hamy son is happy
 yakotunháhele÷ khey§hamy daughter is happy
It is also possible to express the same meaning with the particle né=n between the verb
and the noun as in the following:
 lotunháhele÷ né=n AmosAmos is happy
 yakotunháhele÷ né=n WaliMary is happy
 lotunháhele÷ né=n iy§ha my son is happy
 yakotunháhele÷ né=n khey§ha my daughter is happy
Notice how the arrangement of words in a sentence affects the choice of whispered or
non-whispered versions of a word.
Yes-no Questions
There is an easy way to turn any statement into the corresponding yes-no question. Add
the particle k<. This is simply a grammatical word that signals a question. It is always
positioned as the second word in the question.
 lonúhtehe knows
 lonúhte k< does he know?
 lonúhte Amos Amos knows
 lonúhte k< Amosdoes Amos know?
 sanúhteyou know
 sanúhte k< do you know?
 lotunháhele÷ iy§ha my son's happy
 lotunháhele÷ k< iy§hais my son happy?
 sknolúhkwa you love me
 sknolúkhwa÷ k< do you love me?

*baho – grade as a mark, and sinf – as 6th grade, 7th grade etc. sinf is also a class

yaxshi ko’r- with yaxshi being Uzbek for good, well, great, fabulous and ko’r- literally to see;
to feel (see) good/well towards someone/something, look favorably, be disposed well at
someone/something. Both yoq- and yaxshi ko’r- are used to speak about a disposition
towards people and activities. When using yoq- don’t forget to add ga – a directional

9. Role-play the dialogues above using the map of Uzbekistan.
In English a yes/no question is formed by changing the word order of the sentence. In Uzbek this is not the case;
word order remains the same. Instead, the suffix +mi is attached to the very end of the final word of the
sentence. The one exception is with the second-person (plural or singular, formal or informal) where the +mi
precedes the pronominal suffix (+san, +siz, or +sizlar).* So:
Am I Uzbek? = Men o’zbekmanmi?",0,SOV,"Based on the information provided, it is not enough to determine the dominant word order of the language described in the grammar.

Uzbek,"O’qituvchi
To pluralize any noun in Uzbek you simply add the plural suffix +lar to it. It is generally attached directly to the
noun it is pluralizing. Possessive suffixes and prepositional suffixes (cases) follow it. So:
Name = Ism
Names= Ismlar
My Names = Ismlarim
In My Names=Ismlarimda = Ism+lar+im+da = Name+s+my+in
Agglutination (word combination) in Uzbek almost always works this way (noun+plural+possessive+case). Try
to keep to this order as much as possible.

condicionamiento gramatical, pues el objeto, que no lleva marca formal distintiva, y que
puede confundirse con el sujeto en la 3 persona, se identifica como tal gracias a su posición
con respecto al verbo 75. En guaraní criollo, el paso de OV a VO fue posible junto con el
acompañamiento de otros cambios estructurales, como es el uso de –pe „Dativo/Locativo‟
para marcar el complemento de objeto, la incorporación de artículos determinados el, lo, e
indeterminados un ~ uno, etc. para indicar el estatus topical de la información, etc. (Cf. Cerno
2010a: 32, Dietrich 2009: 9).
74
 Se trata de un cambio temprano, ya que el mismo orden SVO se observa hoy en lenguas sólo hace pocas
décadas expuestas a un contacto intensivo con el español o el portugués, como son el mbyá, el kaiwá, y el
guaraní chaqueño (Dooley 2006a: 135, Dietrich 2009: 8, González 2005: 290, Faria Cardozo 2008: 144-145).
Dietrich: “[…] en las lenguas que tenían pocos contactos externos en el pasado, este cambio del orden de
palabras [es decir de SOV a SVO] se observa ahora: es un cambio inicial y asimétrico, en el sentido de que es
evidente en la generación joven, pero todavía no se nota en la de los hablantes ancianos” (2009: 1-2).
75
Por ejemplo en anambé -lengua tupí-guaraní hablada en el estado de Pará (Brasil)-: mo jawãti u-„u serpiente
perro 3-morer „la serpiente mordió al perro‟, donde la interpretación *„el perro mordió a la serpiente‟ es errónea
(ver Dietrich 2009: 2). En guaraní jesuítico, dice Montoya “lo ordinario es poner primero la persona agente, y
luego la paciente, y luego el verbo, ut: Peru so‟o o‟u („Pedro comió carne‟)”, (Arte: 34).
",1,SVO,"The language described in the grammar has a dominant word order of ""OV(S)"", which means the object precedes the verb and the subject has relatively free placement.

7.4 Orden de los constituyentes
7.4.1. Analizamos en este parágrafo el orden de los constituyentes en la oración transitiva. En
nuestra variedad se observa, en la oración declarativa independiente, un orden básico de
palabras de tipo VO, es decir con el objeto sucediendo al verbo, siendo el sujeto de colocación
relativamente independiente. Se trata del orden neutro, no marcado. La situación es paralela al
G.P. (cf. Dietrich 2009: 6; Tonhauser et al 2010: § 4.1). En el ejemplo (35) observamos SVO;
en (36), el esquema más frecuente VO:
(35)El viého ndaje o-japo h-óga amo-ite
Art viejo Rep 3-hacer 3MP-casa Adv.Loc-Int
S VO
„el viejo dicen que hizo una casa allá lejos‟
(36)a-korta-pa el so‟o-so‟o omia
1-cortar-todo Art carne-Rdp Dem.Pl
V O
„corté toda la carne‟
 124
De una muestra de 105 oraciones con verbo transitivo o ditransitivo, VO resulta la expresión
más frecuente, con 65 casos72. La segunda posición la ocupa el orden SVO, con 12 casos. La
tercera posición corresponde a VOS, con 5 realizaciones. La posición del objeto antecediendo
al verbo resulta la menos frecuente, con 4 casos. De aquí interpretamos que la anteposición
del objeto al verbo, es decir OV, constituye una opción marcada:
(37) opéi ñandu ndo-juhu ro-ina
 Adv.Tem ñandu 1Pl.Ex-encontrar 1Pl.Ex-Prog
 OV
 „después ñandú encontramos‟
Pese a la alta frecuencia con la que ocurre VO, en guaraní moderno está visto que el
orden de palabras no cumple una función gramatical, es decir no responde a la definición de
los roles semánticos de los argumentos. Como se ha visto, en guaraní la ambigüedad en los
papeles semánticos sólo se presenta en la 3 persona, pero objeto y sujeto son desambiguados
por referencia al conocimiento del mundo que poseen los hablantes, y no mediante elementos
gramaticales73. En esta lengua, la diferencia entre un orden VO y OV corresponde a una
función pragmática, relacionada con el grado de relevancia de la información. La relevancia
es de grado creciente, con el sujeto de naturaleza temática (tema = información conocida), el
verbo de carácter más remático y el objeto como rema (= información nueva). Esta estructra
de tipo Tema – Rema es lo que vemos en los ejemplos (35) y (36).
",1,SVO,"The dominant word order in the language described in the grammar is ""VO"", which means the object comes after the verb.",SVO,0,0,
Guaraní," Esto también ocurre si una 3 persona actúa sobre otra 3 persona: oi-nupã Juán-pe
 “pegó a Juan”. Cuando la 1 persona actúa sobre la 2 persona, otro paradigma es
 252
 requerido,elde las marcas “portmanteau”,cuya referencia es doble:
 „1Agente/2Paciente‟: ro-nupã „te pego‟, po-nupã „os pego‟. Cuando la jerarquía de
 persona se invierte, es decir, si la 3 persona actúa sobre la 2 o la 1 persona, o si la 2
 persona actúa sobre la 1, la correferencia es a la 1 o 2 persona como referentes de una
 oración existencial, con lo que las marcas del paradigma inactivo (paradigma che-) son
 requeridas: che-nupã „(hay) golpe con respecto a mí‟ / “me golpean”, nde-r-echa
 2MP-Rel-vista „(hay) (su) vista con respecto a ti‟ / “te ven”. Con esto, la construcción
 pasa de verbal, transitiva, a nominal, existencial. Hemos presentado argumentos para
 sostener que las marcas de la serie che- no deben ser consideradas pronombres de
 objeto (ver § 6.4.4, § 8.1.3 y § 7.3.4), porque la oración no es transitiva: no hay, en
 efecto, un verbo en la oración, ni hay un elemento que pueda identificarse claramente
 como un Agente. Otros participantes de la escena se eliden, pues se consideran
 información conocida. Cuando aparecen en la construcción, se interpretan como
 determinantes de una frase nominal: ha‟e (kuéra) che-nupã „hay su/s golpe/s con
 respecto a mí‟. La glosa “él/ellos me golpea/n” para esta oración constituye, desde
 nuestra perspectiva, una adaptación de la sintaxis guaraní a la perspectiva de las
 lenguas indoeuropeas, y es por tanto inexacta.
7. Otros constituyentes oracionales pueden ser atributos y argumentos oblicuos. Los
 primeros se forman por nominalización, mediante el sufijo –va que transforma un
 predicado nominal o verbal en dependiente de un núcleo nominal: o-ú-va „el que
 vino‟, i-tujá-va „el que es viejo‟ (ver § 6.4, § 10.1.8). Los argumentos oblicuos se
 indican con los sufijos locativos. El sistema de sufijos locativos presenta isomorfismo
 regular con respecto al G.P., en el plano semántico, con un morfema –pe definido
 como „ámbito/lugar‟, por oposición a –Wi „origen‟ y -koto „dirección‟, -re „contacto
 puntual‟, -ipi „contacto difuso‟, -rehe „sociativo1‟ y –ndi „sociativo2‟ (§ 14). En el
 plano de la expresión hemos señalado en nuestro dialecto la variación con respecto al
 G.P., registrando –ipi, -koto, -Wi, -ãri „sobre‟ y –pe como equivalentes a -rupi, -kótyo,
 -gui, -ári y pe ~ me en G.P. (§ 14, § 5.8., § 5.9, § 5.14.6). Este último sufijo,
 Locativo/Dativo –pe con alomorfo -me para ambiente nasal, presenta en G.C. sólo un
 alomorfo oral para todos los contextos: guarani-pe (por G.P. guarani-me) (§ 5.14.2)
8. Entre los mecanismos de formación de palabras, observamos el funcionamiento de los
 procedimientos de modificación (diminutivos, aumentativos, etc.), notando casos de
 253
 sustitución de materia léxica tradicional por significantes prestados. Los diminutivos –
 ‟i y –mi se reemplazan por el préstamo –síto (esp. -cito) (§ 15.1.1). La negación léxica
 -y es sustituida por la preposición prestada sin: t-uguy-‟y 3Abs-sangre-Neg.Lex, se
 expresa sin tuguy „sin sangre‟ (§ 12.1.5). Las expresiones prestadas dema (esp. de
 mas) y de‟éra (¿? esp. de veras) funcionan como intensificadores, compitiendo con los
 tradicionales -ite e –iterei. Las partículas atenuadoras del imperativo (na, mi) son
 sustituidas en este dialecto por medios contextuales (prosódicos) y sólo registramos el
 intensificador de la orden ke (§ 9.3.2 y § 15.1.1). En esta sección hemos presentado
 argumentos para describir los procesos de incorporación de objeto como un
 mecanismo de formación de palabras (modificación), y no como un mecanismo de
 reducción de valencia (§ 15.1.6). Entre los nominalizadores, se nota la escasa
 productividad -ha1 „nomina agentis‟, optándose por el uso del nominalizador oracional
 –va (§ 15.3.3).
9. En el plano de la combinación de cláusulas, observamos el uso de conjunciones para
 lograr la coordinación (aditiva ha, adversativa péro, disyuntiva sino ~ máke). La
 coordinación asindética, recurso tradicional, es posible con ciertas clases de verbos (de
 percepción, “modales”, verba dicendi) (§ 13.1 y § 13.2). Otra forma de obtener la
 combinación de cláusulas es la nominalización, con un nombre deverbalizado que
 puede ocupar la función de argumento nuclear (cuando nominalizado con –ha1 y sus
 derivados ha-guã „Nom+Pros‟ y ha-gue „Nom+Perf‟) o de atributo (cuando
 nominalizado con –va) (§ 13.3.1 - § 13.3.3). Por este medio se obtiene lo que es
 equivalente a las completivas de sujeto/objeto del español, y a las cláusulas relativas,
 respectivamente. Las completivas circunstanciales se logran por sufijación de
 morfemas locativos al nominalizador -ha2: p.e. -há-pe „Nom+Loc‟. Las subordinadas
 adverbiales se logran mediante sufijos con función gerundiva, dividiéndose el dominio
 semántico en „circunstancias generales‟, „temporalidad‟, „causales‟ y „adversativas‟ (§
 13.3.4). Las de „circunstancias generales‟, si bien pueden interpretarse como las
 “condicionales” del español, abarcan un dominio semántico diferente, relativo a una
 condición o circunstancia. Las adverbiales „causales‟, por su parte, efectuadas
 mediante el hispanismo póke (esp. porque), constituyen una innovación reciente,
 motivada por contacto. Hemos señalado también que el plano de la combinación de
 cláusulas constituye uno de los niveles que más acusa el impacto del contacto con el
 español, con la sustitución de algunas formas tradicionales por conjunciones prestadas
254
(como -mboyve y –rire por ãnte y despue), la incorporación de funciones y formas
directamente importadas del español, como póke, péro, sino ~ máke, y la creación de
oposiciones calcadas del español, representadas por formas nuevas o híbridas, como –
tere y -ha‟óra (§ 13.3.1.2 y § 13.3.4.1).
10. En el plano del orden de palabras, se ha observado que el orden normal no marcado en
este dialecto es VO, como en G.P., siendo S de colocación relativamente libre. Se ha
establecido que este orden no responde a motivaciones gramaticales, sino pragmáticas,
relacionadas con la relevancia informativa de los constituyentes oracionales. La
inversión del orden normal, es decir OV, constituye una opción enfática. (§ 7.4).
",1,SVO,"The language described in the grammar has a dominant word order of VO, with S having relatively free placement. However, there is also the option of OV for emphasis.",SVO,0,0,
Guaraní," 126
7.4.3. En nuestra variedad, el orden de palabras tradicional OV(S) subsiste en otros niveles de
la gramática. Así tenemos un orden paralelo OV en la estructura de la determinación nominal
referencial (39.a, ver § 10.1.4.1), en la determinación pronominal (39.b) y en la construcción
posposicional (39.c). A nivel del léxico, este orden se observa en la formación de palabras
mediante incorporación nominal (39.d-e) y pronominal (39.f-g), la incorporación con ‟o
(39.h-i, ver § 15.1.6), y en casos de composición de tipo nombre+verbo (39.j, ver § 15.4.2):
(39)

8. Clases gramaticales menores: pronombres y otras proformas
8.1. Pronombres personales
8.1.1. Pronombres personales con función de sujeto
8.1.1.1. En las lenguas tupí-guaraníes los pronombres personales libres corresponden a las
marcas personales de la serie 2, o paradigma che-, siendo los pronombres formas tónicas e
independientes, en tanto y las marcas personales son átonas y dependientes. A modo de
ejemplo, transcribo los pronombres libres y los prefijos personales de la dicha serie tal como
ocurren en guaraní paraguayo, mbya, kamaiurá y tapiete:

 Se trata de textos narrativos de 3 informantes: A.G., T.P. y L.G. Fueron contabilizadas oraciones con verbos
transitivos o ditransitivos, sin tener en cuenta si la realización de los complementos es o no expresa. La muestra,
se entiende, no es exhaustiva sino exploratoria. Los resultados son VO = 62, SVO = 12, V = 11, VS = 6, VOS =
5, OV = 4, VSO = 3, SV 2.
73
 La ambigüedad sólo es posible cuando una 3 persona actúa sobre otra 3 persona. Dado que el verbo siempre
lleva marca personal, no hay ambigüedad posible para la 1 o 2 personas actuando sobre una 3, o una 1 persona
actuando sobre una 2 o 3, o una 1 sobre una 2. Cuando los dos argumentos de la oración transitiva poseen
agentividad y/o animacidad, la lengua dispone de la marca –pe „no Agente‟ para evitar la ambigüedad: Juan
oinupã Pédro-pe „Juan le pegó a Pedro‟ (ver § 7.2.1 y § 7.2.2). En los casos de suspensión de la transitividad, es
decir con la inversión de la jerarquía de persona, no hay ambigüedad posible dadas las condiciones de las
referencias personales en el predicado (ver § 8.1.3).

 In addition to the above generalities, there are significant constraints on word order:
 SVO, VSO, and VOS orders are not possible and OVS is highly marked and only used in
7
stylized speech. In all constructions objects always proceed verbs. Lastly adverbial
adjuncts regularly proceed the VP. Given these word-order restrictions, it seems highly
unlikely that Hidatsa is a non-configurational language.

 I will show that Hidatsa is a configurational language with an internal hierarchy in
 its VP. There are two main arguments for this: Hidatsa has a fixed SOV word order except
 in topicalization and focus constructions and there is evidence for subject/object
 asymmetries.

Hidatsa," Hidatsa has no such system. Lexical DPs are not marked for case and hence, word
 order is the most significant factor in distinguishing subjects from objects. Canonical
 unmarked word order is SOV. The only exceptions to this rule of word order are found in
 marked cases such as topicalization and focus constructions. Examples of canonical SOV
 word order are shown in (7) and (8).

5.3 Non-derived ditransitive verbs
A small number of non-derived ditransitive verbs subcategorize for two objects. Nevertheless,
utterances with the agent, direct object, and indirect object noun phrases overtly specified almost
never occur in natural discourse. Participants are typically introduced one by one in intransitive
or transitive clauses, and in intransitive clauses at least one of them is disambiguated by context.
Direct objects are disambiguated from indirect object mainly by word order, especially if other
clues, such as differences in animacy, are not available. The three most common ditransitive
active verbs are listed in (9) and an example with overt direct and indirect object is (10).

The First Maker was travelling along (they say). He was roaming around, traveling
along the riverbank and scrutinizing the landscape; he was doing that, going around, and
there were two men sitting there, catching fish at the river (they say). Standing here he
watched them and he examined them and one could hear the men talking to each other,
but they were not looking around (they say). (Jones 1978: 5)
If a transitive clause has two overtly expressed arguments outside the verb stem, they
need to be disambiguated from each other. The need for disambiguation becomes even more
pronounced in light of the relatively flexible word order that Hidatsa has. The unmarked
constituent order in transitive clauses is AOV, but this may be scrambled for pragmatic reasons.
The order of A and B-set agreement prefixes on a transitive stem, which, with a few exceptions,
always follows the order O-A (B-set prefix followed by a A-set prefix), is never affected by the
pragmatic constituent order outside the stem.

Hup,"Hup shows general consistency between its clausal and phrasal constituent
order patterns, according to the word order universals originally established by
Greenberg (1966). As objects precede verbs, so do relative clauses, demonstra-
tives, numerals, and genitives (i.e., possessors) precede the noun phrases they
modify, and nouns precede adpositions. Adjectives, on the other hand, follow
nouns, in line with Dryer’s (1992) observation that a correlation between the
order of object/verb and adjective/noun is cross-linguistically weak.

Hup,"788 Simple clauses
Although they solicit a yes-no answer, these questions front a non-
predicative constituent of the clause, which is understood (via this fronting stra-
tegy) to be the focus of the question. In many cases, this results in a semi-
rhetorical question – i.e., a question to which one already knows the answer and
is simply soliciting agreement or confirmation, rather than more substantial
information. Thus in Hup this type of interrogative, which is the least formally
marked subtype, also corresponds to the least information-oriented interrogative
– a cross-linguistically common pattern (Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 180).195
It is also important to note that this the strategy of fronting a focused argu-
ment of the clause is a property of declarative (and other) clauses in Hup (see
§17.3.1), and is not limited to interrogatives, just as subject-verb inversion is
found in both declarative and interrogative clauses that lack an argument focus
(see above). That interrogative word order is paralleled by declarative word
order, which in turn may be motivated by considerations relating to information
structure, suggests that some of the same pragmatic principles are also histori-
cally responsible for the word order patterns of the Hup interrogatives, although
these have since been systematized and made obligatory.

Hup,"While the incorporation-lacking Tukanoan and Arawak languages in the re-
gion may have provided the model for the marginalization of noun incorpora-
tion in Hup, it is possible that a word order shift was the catalyst. Basic word
order is currently variable across the family: OSV in Nadëb, SVO in Dâw, and
440The compound verb
SOV in Hup and Yuhup (although all are relatively flexible). This variability,
and the fact that Hup/Yuhup word order is identical to that of the Tukanoan and
Arawak languages of the region, together might suggest that Hup (and Yuhup)
have undergone a word order shift that brought them closer to the areal template
(perhaps via a markedness shift enabled by the relatively free word order that
still exists among the Nadahup languages). If Hup did change its basic word
order to adopt an OV pattern, then this could have easily allowed incorporated
objects to be reanalyzed as free constituents. However, the fact that other fea-
tures of Hup are on the whole typologically consistent with OV word order
(e.g., Hup’s ordering of Noun and Relative clause, its strong preference for
postpositions, etc.), whereas Dâw and Nadëb are less internally consistent, casts
doubt on this scenario; perhaps it was Hup’s sister languages, and not Hup, that
underwent a shift in basic word order at some point in the past.
",1,SOV,The language described in the grammar has an SOV dominant word order.,SOV,0,0,
Hup,"Actual Hup discourse provides few clues to establishing one order of core
nominal arguments as more ‘basic’ than another, because clauses containing
both a full (non-pronominal) nominal subject and object are rare, as noted
above. When these do occur, the order of subject and object is flexible, and is
subject to pragmatic considerations – in general, newer or more focused infor-
mation is fronted, while more topical arguments tend to come later in the clause.
However, a text count of such clauses does suggest that AOV order is at least
twice as common as OAV order, which supports the apparent preference for
AOV order found in elicitation contexts, as discussed above. A text example of
AOV order is given in (10); the alternative OAV order (in which the speaker is
focusing on the object, Curupira) in (11).

The order of pronominal objects relative to other nominal constituents also
depends on pragmatics; they tend to follow full nominal agents in the clause
(example 12), but this is not obligatory (13):

As is common in many languages, pronominal subjects in Hup (which tend
to be highly topical) almost always immediately precede the verb in the clause
(examples 14–15) (resulting in a default OAV order). Because pronominal ob-
jects are obligatorily case-marked, ambiguity in the identity of core syntactic
arguments is always avoided when one argument is a pronoun. Probably as a
result of this preference for pronominal subjects to directly precede the verb,
they have acquired some of the characteristics of proclitics when in this position
in the clause (i.e., lack of stress, and a tendency for the third person singular
pronoun th to be phonologically dependent on the verb in the Umari Norte
dialect; see §3.4.2.1 and §6.1).

Despite the strong preference for subject pronouns to directly precede the
verb, this is not obligatory in the Hup clause (although this order appears to be
more fixed in the Umari Norte dialect, in keeping with the pronouns’ more
clitic-like identity in that dialect). Focused pronominal subjects typically pre-
cede objects (especially where these are themselves pronominal), as in example

repetition as a right-dislocated argument.

‘I would kill him, I (would)!’ (txt)
Nevertheless, Hup has a number of strategies for maintaining its preference for
immediately preverbal pronominal subjects in transitive clauses. For example,
subjects are often referred to initially via a pronoun, and only made explicit
post-verbally as an external argument to the main clause:
(17) th hehé/-éh, th- n, yúp doh/ãêy-ãêh
3sg laugh.loudly-DECL 3sg-OBJ that.ITG Curupira-DECL
‘She laughed loudly at her, (did) that Curupira (wife).’ (txt)
It is also fairly common to have a full nominal subject and a co-referential (re-
sumptive) pronoun together in same clause, as in (18), especially in the Umari
Norte dialect.
(18) y-nh-yó/=mahba/t‡b’ thpe/pe/-kót-óh

‘Then, it’s said, the spirit went groping around.’ (txt)
This prevalence of pronominal subjects, which appear to be marginally procliti-
cized to the verb, may represent an early step towards the historical develop-
ment of a system of pronominal clitics – a process which, when further devel-
oped, often gives rise to verbal person agreement. Such systems of person-
marking on the verb are fairly common in Amazonian languages.

17.3. Declarative clauses
This section treats the declarative clause in Hup. Declarative clauses are defined
both by constituent order and morphological marking, and include both affirma-
tive and negative statements, as well as non-verbal clauses involving predicate
nominals, adjectives, and locatives.
17.3.1. Constituent order in the declarative clause
Constituent order in Hup is relatively flexible, but the basic (formally least-
marked) pattern is clearly verb-final. Defining the order of nominal arguments
in the transitive clause is more difficult, but the ‘basic’ constituent order can
arguably be identified as AOV. The actual order of constituents appears to be
determined primarily by pragmatics, principally the relative newness or given-
ness of information. Other relevant factors that correlate with word order are
verbal tense and aspect, and the identity of nominal constituents as pronouns or
full lexical nouns. Both context and the existence of morphological core case-
marking (see §4.3.1), which corresponds to a consistently nominative-
accusative alignment system, help to disambiguate syntactic arguments.
",1,SOV,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the language described in the grammar has no dominant word order.

 object. However, when clauses are used in isolation, and in examples not taken from natural
 text, the old Numic historical word-order of subject-object-verb (SOV) tends to predominate,
 a convention maintained in out-of-context examples here.

 4.1.6â•… Word order
 As noted earlier above (ch. 3), Ute has flexible word order, determined not by the
 grammatical roles of subject and object (as in English), but by subtle discourse-
 pragmatic considerations. In later chapters, we will deal with the pragmatics of Ute
 word-order in connected discourse (chs 7, 17, 18). Since the earlier historical word-
 order of Ute (and Numic) was subject-object-verb (SOV); since this is still the most
 frequent word-order found in natural discourse; and since when speakers produce
 clauses in isolation they tend to produce them in the SOV word-order, illustrative
 examples of out-of-context simple clauses throughout this book will conform to the
 SOV word-order. In all truth, the isolated clause outside its natural communicative
 context is a convenient descriptive fiction. It is useful at the beginning stages of gram-
 matical analysis and description, but must ultimately be supplemented by data from
 natural communication.

 4.1.4â•… Grammatical relations

 assume some grammatical relation, or case-role, in the clause. Of those, the most
 common ones are:

                 b. direct object (o)
                 c. indirect object (io)

 4.1.5â•… Constituency and hierarchic structure
 A clause is not just a string of words and morphemes arranged in linear order. While
 the linear order in which words and morphemes appear is an important feature of the
 grammar, the clause also has a more abstract hierarchic constituent structure, the way
 in which the whole is divided into parts, and those parts into sub-parts. The formal
Chapter 4.â•‡ Simple clauses ïœ¶ïœ·
device used to describe the hierarchic structure of clauses is called phrase-structure
tree diagrams. While we will attempt to not make excessive use of this device, what
it describes is real.3 As an illustration of this property of the syntax of simple clauses,
consider the following simple clause in Ute:
(7) mamachi �u �áapachi �uway p}nikyay-kya
                 woman/s the/s boy/othe/o see-ant
                 ‘The woman saw the boy’
 In (7) above, the clause is characterized only by its linear order, of the words in
the clause and the morphemes in the word. One could now add to this description the
hierarchic constituent structure of parts and sub parts of the whole, as in:
(8) C

N DEFN DEF
mamachiu áapachiuwayp}nikyay-kya

‘The woman saw the boy’
 The description in (8) can be read from the top down and from left to right as
follows:
• The whole clause (C) is made of two parts, in order: subject noun phrase (SU/NP)
 and verb phrase (VP).
• The subject NP is made of two parts, in order: the noun (N) mamachi ‘woman’ and
 a definite article (DEF) �u ‘the’.
• The verb phrase (VP) is made of two parts, in order: the object noun phrase (O/NP)
 and a verb (V) p}nikyay-kya ‘saw’.
• The object NP is made of two parts, in order: the noun (N) �áapachi ‘boy’ and the
 definite article (DEF) �uway ‘the’.

reflexive morpheme nanbs ‘self ’. Thus compare the active-transitive in (9a) below with
its reflexive counterpart (9b). The co-reference relation here is between the subject and

6.5 General structure of the verbal clause
 The verb phrase is the only obligatory element in the verbal clause.
Neutral order in Abau is SOV, but this order can readily be altered for
pragmatic reasons. Background or given information is placed at the
beginning of the sentence and topicalised accordingly. Foreground or
prominent information is placed preceding the verb phrase. The phrase
that immediately precedes the VP forms the comment of the utterance.

Abau," The most common order within Abau is SOV, but this order can
easily be changed to OSV. The syntactic role of NPs is not determined by
their place within the sentence but by their NP marking. As stated before,
nearly all NPs are marked syntactically and/or pragmatically. A large
percentage of NPs is marked for either subject or object, and the speaker
might make use of SOV or OSV order depending on the prominence he
wants to assign to the NPs (see §8.6.1). NPs which are not marked for
subject or object are very often topicalised by general topic markers
(§3.6). In spite of this lack of syntactic marking, these NPs can still have
patient or agent function, which is mostly determined by the context.
Their marking, or lack of marking, also determines how NPs are given
more or less prominence (see §8.6.2).
8.6.1 Changing prominence of subject
 Normal order within Abau is SOV, but based on prominence choices
a speaker can change this order. In (47), the order is changed to OSV. The
object NP Keno se kokwe is obligatorily topicalised, because it has been
left-located and is therefore placed in the topic part of the sentence (see
325
§8.3). The topicalised object precedes the non-topicalised subject ur hiy

Moghol," Phonologie
 In der Phonetik stellen wir das Lautinventar der Moghol-Sprache nach
Qualitaten und Quantitaten dar, ermitteln also die artikulatorischen und
akustischen Merkmale der Laute. In der Phonologie haben wir die be-
deutungsdifferenzierende Funktion dieser phonetischen Lautmerkmale
herauszustellen. Hierbei ist nicht der Einzellaut als solcher Ausgangs-
punkt unserer Betrachtung, sondern dessen Kombination mit anderen
Lauten zu einem Wortk6rper. Ein Einzellaut fiir sich ist namlich nur
selten ein Wort, da er meist kein Bedeutungstrager ist. In der Regel ist
erst ein aus einzelnen Lauten zusammengesetztes Wort Bedeutungstrager
oder Zeichen, das sich von anderen Wartern oder Zeichen durch die Laute,
aus denen es besteht, abhebt und unterscheidet. Die Sprachlaute sind
somit Kennzeichen in einem Wort, und zwar fUr den Bedeutungsinhalt
dieses Wortes, der von einem anderen Bedeutungsinhalt zu unterscheiden
ist. Diese Kennzeichen, d. h. Laute mit bedeutungsdifferenzierender
Funktion, nennen wir Phoneme. Die Phoneme einer Sprache herauszu-
arbeiten, ist Aufgabe der Phonologie. Ihre Verbindung zur Phonetik
besteht darin, daB sie zwischen phonologisch relevanten (bedeutungs-
differenzierenden) und phonologisch irrelevanten (nicht bedeutungs-
differenzierenden) phonetischen Merkmalen eines Lautes unterscheidet.
Ein Phonem ist somit eine auf Grundlage der Phonetik mittels des
phonologischen Verfahrens ermittelte Kombination von Merkmalen, die
sich in einer Sprache von allen ubrigen Merkmalkombinationen unter-
scheiden. Das phonologische Verfahren, derartige Merkmale, d. h. Pho-
neme herauszustellen, besteht in der Gegenuberstellung (Opposition) der
phonetischen Merkmale zweier Warter, die sich dabei nicht nur hinsicht-
lich eines ihrer Laute, sondern auch in der Bedeutung als voneinander
verschieden erweisen. Die einzelnen Phoneme sind die jeweils fur die
Bedeutungsdifferenzierung verantwortlichen, voneinander verschiedenen
phonetischenLautmerkmale, z. B.: [uk'i(n)] ""Madchen"": [ek'i(n)] ""Kopf"".
lui und lei erweisen sich als bedeutungsdifferenzierend, sind also zwei
Phoneme. Sichtbar gemacht wird das Verfahren durch den Austausch
 (Kommutation) von Lauten. Hierbei wird entweder das Wort zerstart,
oder es ergibt sich ein neues Wort, dessen dafiir verantwortliches Laut-
merkmal ein weiteres Phonem aufdeckt. Z.B.: Ersetzen wir das [k] von
94Phonologie
[s:k'i(n)] ""Kopf"" durch [m], wird das Wort zerstort. Ersetzen wir es da-
gegen durch [r], ergibt sich das Verb [s:ri-] ""wunschen"". Irl erweist sich
dadurch als Phonem. Ebenso bei [R'ol] ""Feuer"" : [m'ol] ""Vieh"", [n'ur]
""Gesicht"" : [m'ur] ""Weg"", [€llA] ""dies"" : [inA-] ""lachen"", wodurch die
Phoneme Ig/, Im/, In/, lei und Iii aufgedeckt werden. Phoneme bezeich-
nen also durch ihre Opposition zu anderen Phonemen ein Wort als
speziell diese und keine andere Bedeutung tragend.

Moghol," 3. Akzent
 Mit Akzent bezeichnen wir allgemein die groBere Schallfiille oder
hohere Tonlage, durch die eine Silbe innerhalb eines mehrsilbigen Wortes
hervorgehoben wird. In der Moghol-Sprache ist mit der groBeren Schall-
ftiIle einer Silbe auch eine hohere Tonlage verbunden, die beide gegen-
tiber den umliegenden Silben den Ton stark konzentrieren. Wir bezeich-
nen diesen Akzent als zentralisierenden Akzent. Die Stellung dieses
zentralisierenden Akzentes ist frei-konstant. Die Akzentfreiheit ergibt
sich aus folgendem: Die meisten der tiberwiegend aus zwei, zuweilen aus
drei oder mehr Stammsilben bestehenden Wi:irter konnen sein: 1. Meist
Oxytona, z.B.: [tfos'un], [dfol' A] , [tfAR'on], [kauk'A], [irg'od], [musul-

[qur'um], [t'e:ndA], [s'um]. 3. Sporadisch Proparoxytona, wobei es sich
meist um zusammengesetzte Worter handelt: [mor'insowAr], [qAr'otfu-
sutu]. Die Konstanz des Akzentes tritt vor aHem bei der Verbalflexion
zutage, wo z.B. im Prasens bei vokalischem Stammauslaut in der Regel

Moghol,"ABRISS DER SATZLEHRE
1. Subjekt-Pradikat, Parataxe
 Das SUbjekt steht in der Moghol-Sprache gew6hnlich am Satzbeginn,
und das Pradikat in Form eines finiten Verbums am Satzende. Diese
Regel wird durchbrochen, wenn ein Satz mit einer pers. Konj unktion
eingeleitet wird, d.h. wenn der Nebensatz VOl' dem Hauptsatz steht.
Auch kann eine finite Verbform am Satzbeginn stehen, wenn das Sub-
jekt in diesem Verb enthalten ist, z.B.: aga arzata tomU8U (K229) ""Ich
werde bleiben und die Hirse aufsammeln"". uzaba ke mona falau noir
urcifa (K232) ""Er sah, daB der Junge in Schlaf gefallen war"". Ein Satz
kann Oftel' zwei finite Pradikate hintereinander haben, z. B.: auloi
ikinduini urciba muUa unoba ukuba (K200) ""Er lief auf den Gipfel des
Berges, fiel dort herunter und starb"". Diese Haufung finiter Pradikate,
die ohne ein Bindewort nebeneinander stehen, erklart sich daraus,
daB in der Moghol-Sprache die ein Pradikat naher bestimmenden Konver-
ben bzw. die Verbalnomina nul' noch selten gebraucht werden. Aus dem
gleichen Grund k6nnen in einem Satz mehrere finite Pradikate stehen,
150AbriJ3 der Satzlehre
die nicht unmittelbar aufeinander folgen. Solche finiten Verbformen
ersetzen die nicht mehr vorhandenen perfektischen und imperfektischen
Konverben und Verbalnomina, z. B.: bego serob idaM mast bolta kouna
alaM (D88) ""Sie trank nachts Wein, wurde besoffen und t6tete ihr Kind"".
Man vergleiche hierzu einen entsprechend aufgebauten Satz im UM: mar-
tUr ireged ger-tUr-iyen oroyad kabegun-iyen alafu.qui ""Er kam auf dem Weg
daher, betrat sein Haus und t6tete seinen Sohn"". Strukturell ist durch
diese Pradikatshaufung der parataktische Sprachbau des Mongolischen
erhalten geblieben. Parataktischer Sprachbau hat sich auch bei den ver-
balnominalen Formen und Suffixen osala und -ksosa erhalten, unbe-
schadet dessen, daB wir sie hypotaktisch ubersetzen. Letztere Konstruk-
tionen sind aber sehr selten. Uberwiegend erscheinen in der Moghol-
Sprache dafur Satztypen, die diesen Dialekt einer hypotaktischen Kon-
struktion zuweisen.

auf dem Vokal der Verneinungspartikel, z. B.: [s' Akibubi] ""ich habe
nicht gemacht""; [l'E:ldAnAmbi] ""ich esse nicht""; [s'ootfolpAto] ""ihr habt
nicht getrunken"". Die Intensitat dieses frei-konstanten zentralisierenden
Akzentes tibert6nt in der Moghol-Sprache nicht nur die unmittelbar
folgende Silbe, sondern kann sich mit ihrer tonalen Magnetkraft bis tiber
drei, seltener sogar vier oder fiinf der folgenden Silben erstrecken, d.h.
diese akzentlos halten. In der Praxis k6nnen dadurch W6rter, die nicht
zum akzenttragenden Wort gehOren, hinsichtlich ihrer Betonung enkli-
tisch werden, sofern sie nicht mehr als h6chstens fiinf Silben nach der
akzentuierten Silbe aufweisen. Z. B.: Einwirkung des Akzentes tiber zwei
folgende Silben: [tfirk'uk boldfA] ""wurde schmutzig"" (das sonst akzen-
tuierte [-dfA] , vgl. oben, bleibt unbetont!); [moR'ol bIlA] ""war ein
Moghole""; [dfor'u kInAl ""macht sauber"". Einwirkung des Akzentes tiber
drei folgende Silben: [k'onA boldfA] ""ist alt geworden""; [k'or kebAtfI]
""du hast gearbeitet"". [g'e:r mmi be:] ""ist mein Haus"". Einwirkung des
Akzentes tiber fiinf folgende Silben: [q'Atke:IAtu be:lA] ""war Pastune"".
In solchen Fallen werden die beiden, bzw. die drei W6rter nach dem
Akzent wie ein Wort artikuliert. Bei einer derartigen tonalen Magnet-
kraft des Akzentes auf folgende, semantisch zu unterscheidende Silben,
sagen wir, daB der Akzent in satzgebundener Funktion steht. Diese
Funktion steht im Gegensatz zur wortgebundenen Funktion, womit wir
den Akzent eines Einzelwortes meinen. Der Akzent in satzgebundener
Funktion kann, wie bereits am Beispiel [boldI' A], [tfirk'uk boldfA] gezeigt,
den wortgebundenen Akzent aufheben. Verbindliche Regeln dafiir, wann
dies geschieht, gibt es jedoch nicht. So steht einmal in einem Satz ein
Akzent in satzgebundener Funktion, z. B.: [bibidun' A gA ke:] ""Sag sie zu
ihrer Herrin!"", ein andermal sind die Akzente eines Satzes nur wort-
gebunden: [e:n'A uk'in gAb'A] ""Dies Madchen sagte"".

(1964), followed only recently by another brief survey by Ye. A. Kuz’menkov (1997) as
well as by a monographic treatment by Buhe (1996). Moghol has, however, offered
material for specialized discussions on certain details with considerable relevance to
general Mongolic studies. In particular, the question concerning the long vowels in
Moghol has been discussed by Ligeti (1964) and Weiers (1970). Perhaps even more
importantly, the influences of the Iranian linguistic environment make Moghol an
interesting object for contact linguistics (Poucha 1961, Weiers 1973, 1975b, 1976ab,
1977b, 1978).

Moghol,"Both Spoken Moghol and Written Moghol, as read from texts, reveal the existence of
a strong high pitch. In single words this pitch is located mainly on the last syllable,
seldom on the penult. In the narrative form of the finite conjugation the pitch is located
on the final vowel of the stem, if the stem ends in a vowel or a diphthong, or on the
connective vowel u or o, if the stem ends in a consonant, e.g. ina- ‘to laugh’, inanambi
‘I am laughing’; acar- ‘to bring’, acaronamda ‘we are bringing’. The other finite forms
have the pitch on their respective temporal-aspectual suffixes, e.g. inabobi ‘I laughed’;
acarlanud ‘they were bringing’. Within a clause the pitch height can extend its influence
over the next three syllables, making them clitics, e.g. ger mini be or ger =mini=be ‘[it]
is my house’.
PARTS OF SPEECH
Unlike other Mongolic languages, Moghol has, due to the impact of the Iranian influence,
most of the ‘classical’ parts of speech known from Indo-European languages: substan-
tives, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions. Substantives
are morphologically marked for the categories of number and case. Verbs are characterized
by the categories of person, number, tense-aspect, and mode. Adjectives are distinguished
by the category of degree (comparison), borrowed from Iranian and marked by the
Persian suffixes .tar for the comparative and .tariin for the superlative. Adjectives
function syntactically as attributes or nominal predicates, and they are never marked for
the categories of number and case. Many adjectives are borrowed from Iranian.
",0,SOV,There is not enough information provided in the paragraph to determine the dominant word order of the language described in the grammar.,Not enough information,0,0,
Moghol," For the expression of negation Moghol uses the following negative particles of
Common Mongolic origin, all of which are placed before, and in some cases prefixed to,
the word to be negated: ulah ~ ula- ~ ul- ~ lah ~ la- ‘not’; ugai(-) ~ gai(-) ‘not, without’;
essah ~ essa ~ esah ~ sa- ‘not’. Additionally, the Persian preposition bi ‘without’ is used.
The negation of nominal words, including nominal forms of verbs (participles), takes
place with bi, lah, ugai ~ gai, e.g. bi ci ‘without you’, bi jonun ‘without madness’, lah
or/o.xsh-i lah quina.xsh-i ‘not the forward, not the backward’, lah nudun-du ugai cekin-
du ‘to the one without eyes and without ears’, gai ådål ‘unlike’. In the finite conjugation,
the particle ulah ~ ula- ~ ul- ~ lah ~ la- is used to negate the narrative and durative forms,
e.g. ulah bai-m ulah lula-na-h ‘he does not stay and he will not rotate’, ceni ula-uzha-
na-mbi ‘I will not see you’, ul-årå-m ‘he does not enter’, lah anqas/u-m lah ulas/u-m ‘he
is not hungry, nor thirsty’, la-mida-mbi ‘I do not know’. The negation of existence is
expressed as ugai+be-h ~ gai+be-h ‘it is not, there is not; does not exist’ (with the cop-
ula +be-h). The other finite forms are negated by bi, lah, or essah ~ essa ~ esah ~ sa-,
e.g. bi dur-pa-ci ‘you did not burn’, lah be-la-h ‘has not been’, essah ida-ba-nud ‘they
did not eat’; sa-ira-zha-nci ‘you were not coming’. The prohibitive (negative imperative)
is expressed by the (Mongolic) particle bi(-) or be(-), e.g. bi tus-gha ‘he must not touch’;
be-dur.ga-l.gha-tu ‘you must not allow him to get burned’.
LEXICON
The intensive language contact with the Iranian environment has particularly profound-
ly influenced the Moghol lexicon. More than 70 per cent of the words used in Moghol
are of Persian-Arabic origin. The Moghol lexicon comprises, therefore, (1) native
Mongolic words, (2) loanwords from Persian-Arabic, (3) ‘Mogholizations’ (Moghol
adaptations) of foreign words, and (4) loan translations. A study of the early Moghol
word lists beginning with Leech (1838) reveals relatively little of the development of the
lexicon, though the variation observable in the material may reflect some diachronic or
dialectal patterns (see the section on Dialects above).

Moghol,"The futuritive participle functions (1) as the canonical basic form (entry form) of verbs
in dictionaries and word lists, (2) as an independent substantive (pl. kuz) ‘some, some-
body; person; being; existence’, (3) as a verbal substantive, e.g. ugha-ku ‘(the) washing’,
and (4) as a verbal adjective corresponding to a relative clause. The perfective participle
functions as nomen patientis, e.g. etka-xsah ‘(one that has been) cut’ from etka- ‘to cut’,
åsrå-xsan ‘(one that has been) saved’ from åsrå- ‘to save, to protect’, pl. jåru-xsa-t
‘envoys’ from jåru- ‘to send’, audål/o-xsan-åt ‘creatures’ from audål- ‘to create’. The
agentive participle functions as nomen agentis, e.g. orinzha-xci ‘selfish person’ from
orinzha- ‘to be selfish’, pl. tålå-xci-z ‘those who are counting’ from tålå- ‘to count’,

Moghol," It is obvious from the data that the five sets of personal endings are multiply inter-
dependent both synchronically and diachronically. There is a particularly close connection
between the first and second sets, and also between the third and fourth sets. The fifth set,
consisting mainly of restructured rudiments of the original system of imperative markers,
is most different from the others. In this set, the Common Mongolic optative (1p. sg. -su
< *-sU), permissive (3p. -gha/h < *-gV), voluntative (1p. du. -ya/h : pl. -yan < *-yA/n),
and benedictive (2p. du. -tå : pl. -tu ~ -tuna < *-gtUn) can be immediately identified.
SYNTAX
Like the intonation patterns, the sentence structure of the Moghol language, both spoken
and written, has been intensively influenced by the Tajik-Persian linguistic environment.

MOGHOL 261
The normal word order is subject–object–predicate (SOV), with the predicate slot
being filled by either a finite verb or a predicatively used noun. There is regular agree-
ment between the subject and the predicate with regard to number and person. The
normal sentence may, however, be altered in poetic language in accordance with the rules
of Persian metres, rhymes, and rhythms, which also had to be observed by a Moghol
poet. For instance, to achieve the correct emphasis, the finite verb can be placed at the
beginning of the sentence (VSO), as in å mida-m daidån deksh ti ku- i kåfer bål/u-m
‘And God the Exalted knows this one who becomes an infidel.’
Another element of alien syntactic influence originates in the religious language
derived from Arabic. Arabic elements, introduced by Moghol mullahs into their native
language, have always been farz ‘obligatory’ for every Muslim in his religious life, and
they have thus become effective also in the everyday life and language of the Moghol.
The Persian-Arabic influence is responsible for the expression of hypotactic structures
by using subordinate dependent clauses introduced by subordinating conjunctions and
relative pronouns, non-existent in most other Mongolic languages. The subordinate
clause can either precede or follow the main clause. The following subordinating
conjunctions are attested:
(1) oghlah ‘that’ (functionally corresponding to Arabic anna), introduces a consecu-
tive nominal dependent clause, e.g. å ulah gah-gh/u-m oghlah yad-ni cidån-i be-h ‘and
it should not be said that his hand is his strength’;
(2) ul ‘so that’ (also ‘until’, cf. Mongolic *ulam ‘further, still more’), introduces a final
dependent clause, e.g. du maktab såu.l-gha-h ul sah caqå’ed tah awåmer wåcugh bol-ga-
h ‘he should be placed in a school, so that he can be made aware of the articles of faith
and the orders of communication’;
(3) munkeh ‘that’ (from Moghol mun ‘this’ and Persian keh ‘that’), introduces a con-
secutive dependent clause, e.g. ‘. . .qunah munkeh ghar/u-m sah munah gaiti qoluc/o-xci
‘. . .after he goes out of this world as a believer’;
(4) ul munkeh ‘until’ (from ul and munkeh), introduces a terminal dependent
clause, e.g. wa esah jiji-zha-h sah ti ul munkeh oku-ba-h qoluc/o-xci ghar/u-xci bar
oghlati tu eri-yi daidån dekh be-h ‘and he did not turn away from this until he died as
a believer committing transgressions, so really he is under the volition of God the Exalted’;
(5) kull ghåt ‘when’ (from Arabic kull ‘all, every’ and Moghol ghåt ‘time’), introduces
a temporal dependent clause, e.g. kull ghåt kela-ba-h daidån deksh muså-i kela-ba-h
te- i du kelanni ‘when God the Exalted spoke to Moses, he spoke to him in his language’;
(6) ticur ‘as soon as’ (from Moghol ti ‘this’ + ucur ‘time’), introduces a successive
dependent clause, e.g. å mida-m oghla ti oshtin å-m ticur å-lgha-h ti-’i ‘and he knows
how it is, as soon as he creates it’;
(7) sah ‘if’ (identical with the subjunctive marker -sa, cf. similar forms in both
Mongolic and Turkic), introduces a conditional dependent clause, e.g. farz azhar sah ti
nika-yah å-la-h å sah oroxshi lah be-la-h ‘Farz Azhar [must be recited] if he has been
there himself alone, and if there has not been a precentor’;
(8) sin ‘even if, though’, introduces a concessive dependent clause, e.g. å lah ga-mdah
oghlah ti mughatti-xsan be-h ti-du sin a-gha-h ghar/u-xci ‘and we do not say that he is
one who is forever retained in it even if he becomes a transgressor’;
(9) mun agar sah ‘because’ (from Moghol mun ‘this’ and Persian agar ‘if’, to which
Moghol abl. sah ‘from’ is added), introduces a causal dependent clause, e.g. å gaiti du
kolkah joz-nud-neh moxdas be-h mun agar sah ti cain-nud be-h ‘and the world is in all
its parts created, because it consists of substances’.

Wappo," The place held by the pronominal prefixes is significant. There are
two such groups, the possessive-reflexive (te-, me-, mai'-) and the pro-
nominal objects (ma-, ho-, on-). te- always precedes me-. The former
group always precede the latter, and this suggests that the verb is
apparently conceived of as a noun. In the discussion on syntax we
shall know that in narratives it is treated as a semi-nominalized con-
struction, a possessed object, and that te-, me-, and mai'- also have
the force of relative pronouns. This is apparently an old type of con-
struction in Yukian for Kroeber seems to imply it in what he says of
Yuki proper.'6
 ma- and ho- had perhaps best be interpreted as old proclitic vari-
ants of demonstratives ma- from *me, this, and ho- from he-, the first
set probably not related to the possessive me-. Their development into
prefixes I regard as most certainly due to the nominalizing influence
of te-, me-, and mai'-, and is not at all to be ascribed to any tendency
toward fusion between ho- and ma- and the verb-stem itself. In other
words these prefixes are not of the same order as the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth position elements.
 on- is undoubtedly a recent development and shows quite nicely
how te- etc., welded all the elements that came after it into a more or
less indissoluble phonetic unit. This must have been largely encouraged
by the comparative phonetic- weakness of on- as contrasted with its
original form of ani, the -i of which was apparently.felt as a subjective
case, thus leading to its irregular loss in order to form the objective.

This last property means that such a sentence may be ambiguous in isolation. Thus,
to take (25) as an example, since there is no marking to signal which of the nouns in
the dependent clause is to be interpreted as the head, there is nothing to prevent
interpreting ew ‘fish’ as the head, in which case the sentence would be interpreted:
(25) (ii) ‘I gave the basket to the fish that the man caught’
Note that in both interpretations (i) and (ii), whether k'ew ‘man’ or ew ‘fish’ is
interpreted as the head noun, the agent-patient relation remains unchanged: it is the
man who caught the fish in both cases. While it is true that in this case, the
pragmatics of fish catching men render the reverse interpretation unlikely, it is also
our observation that an SOV word order, with order signalling grammatical
relations, seems to be more rigidly adhered to in dependent clauses than in
independent clauses. In any case, the potential ambiguity of this type of sentence
would typically not be an interpretative problem in actual discourse.
",1,SOV,"Based on the description provided in the paragraph, the language described in the grammar has a dominant SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order, as mentioned in the last sentence of the paragraph: ""an SOV word order, with order signalling grammatical relations, seems to be more rigidly adhered to in dependent clauses than in independent clauses."".",SOV,0,0,
Wappo," A word is in order about the degree of Laura’s fluency. Born before 1890,
Laura was bilingual as a child in Southern Pomo (her father’s language) and Wappo
(her mother’s language). She did not interact much with her father’s side of the
family, but Wappo was the family language, which she spoke with her mother and
siblings. Because her mother was blind, Laura was excused from attending the
school run by the BIA in order to look after her mother. This had the fortunate
consequence of allowing Laura to maintain her Wappo into adulthood. She was thus
able to speak Wappo up to a much later age than most of her contemporaries were
able to maintain their native languages. We do not know how much Pomo Laura
used as an adult, but she was bilingual throughout her adult life in English and
Wappo. Her English was close to that of a native speaker; Sawyer (1991) notes that
occasional discrepancies often seemed to be direct translations from Wappo. She
never learned to read or write, except to sign her name.

 Word Order 5
Patient-initial order was also occasionally offered with yes-no questions, as in:
(4) tahwal'neʔ - khiʔhiʔ miʔ
 jobhave - STAT Q 2SG:NOM
‘do you have a job?’ (lts86)
(4) also illustrates a tendency for topical subjects to appear in clause-final position.
Here are further examples of this:
(5) ʔiʔi, olol - miʔ, cek'ew - i
yes dance - DUR DEM man - NOM
‘yes, (he) dances, that man’ (128)
(6)cel'oni o - paʔ - miʔ, mul' -i
then everybody UOP - eat - DUR all - NOM
o- paʔ - miʔ isa okant - i
 UOP - eat - DUR 1PL relative - NOM
‘then everybody eats, all our relatives eat’ (text F, 305)
With complement clauses, particularly with first person subjects, the word order
becomes considerably freer:
(7) a. ah cek'ew ew ṭ'oh - taʔ haṭis - khiʔ
 1SG:NOM DEM man fish catch - PST know - STAT
b. ah haṭis - khiʔ cek'ew ewṭ'oh - taʔ
 1SG:NOM know - STAT DEM man fish catch - PST
c. cek'ew ew ṭ'oh - taʔ ah haṭis - khiʔ
 DEM man fish catch - PST 1SG:NOM know - STAT
 ‘I know that the man caught a fish’ (lts86)
The verb-medial order seen in (7)b. was never offered or accepted in simple
clauses, as illustrated by:
6 Word Order
(8)*ahhaṭis - khiʔcek'ew
1SG:NOM know - STAT DEM man
(‘I know the man’) (lts86)
Question words were always placed in clause-initial position in volunteered
utterances:
(9) itami - meʔ makinaʔ - i
 where 2SG - GEN car- NOM
 ‘where is your car?’ (160)
(10)thalmiʔpaʔ - ukhhak' - šeʔ
 what 2SG:NOM eat - INF want - DUR
 ‘what do you want to eat?’ (lts87)
Wappo being a predicate-final language, modifiers within noun phrases would
be expected to precede the head noun. While this is true for demonstratives and
genitives, adjectives and numerals are most commonly placed after the noun (see
also section 3.1):
(11) hetonči
 DEM cat
 ‘this cat’ (o)
(12) te - meʔ č'ešma

Within the verb phrase adverbs and oblique arguments, as expected, tend to
precede the verb:

3. THE NOUN PHRASE
3.1 Order of Elements
The noun phrase in Wappo consists minimally of a noun or pronoun and optional
modifiers, as suggested by the following formula:
(1) (Dem) (Gen) N (Numeral/Quantifier) (Adjective)

As suggested by (1), while numerals or quantifiers precede adjectives, any of
these may precede or follow the noun.

 10.3 Word Order in Simple Clauses
 The most frequently attested word order of the core grammatical relations subject (S)
 and object (O) and the predicate (Pred) in Oksapmin is: S O Pred. The basic word
 order remains the same regardless of the illocutionary type of the utterance
 (interrogative, declarative, etc.) and regardless of whether the predicate is verbal or
 not. An example of S O Pred word order is shown in example (10-62) below.

 SOPred
then 1pEX medicine(Eng) (3.O.)give-IPFV.PER.TODP=LINK
‘Then, we gave medicine (to them).’ (“Today” by Henna Kashat)
Although there is a strong tendency for S O Pred word order,3 the word order
 in clauses in Oksapmin is, however, somewhat free apart from a single rigid
 constraint: the predicate occurs clause finally. This freedom of word order is shown in
 the sentences below, both from the same text where the object tom san jox ‘the water
 container’ may precede the subject nox ‘I’ as in (10-63)a. or follow it as in (10-63)b.

 For example, in an analysis of two texts (“Five Brothers” spoken by Dasyal Gahan, and “Today”
 spoken by Julie James), the following frequencies of S O Pred and O S Pred were found. (Note that
 only a small percentage of clauses had overt S and O arguments.)

All parts of the clause except for the predicate are optional where recoverable
 from context and need not be repeated when they have already been mentioned earlier
 in the discourse. This further confuses the matter of word order because constituents
 are not frequently found in combination. The most common clause structure in
 Oksapmin is a verbal predicate with a single noun phrase preceding it, which may
 have any of a variety of functions.4 This structure is common in other languages of
 New Guinea, and is discussed by de Vries (2006) and Heeschen (1998) as
 “distribution”. This phenomenon is succinctly summarized by Foley:
 4
 For example, in an analysis of two texts (“Five Brothers” spoken by Dasyal Gahan, and “Today”
 spoken by Julie James), the clause type breakdown was as follows (where X is a constituent other than
 a discourse marker or predicate, and where each verb was considered a clause except for gerunds,
 nominalised verbs, verbs in a relative clause, and clause chains other than chained full clauses):
 Clause type “Five Brothers” text “Today” text
 Pred18 20
 X Pred57 86
 XX Pred 21 39
 XXX Pred516
 XXXX Pred 02
 Total clauses 101163

 CLAUSAL SYNTAX
 Actual textual structure varies with the individual language and genre type, but some
 generalizations are possible. (a) There is a relatively high ratio of verbs to nominals,
 at least compared with the literate styles of European languages. Often clauses
 contain no nominal or adpositional phrases at all, just verbs, and almost never are
 there more than two. (b) Given or presupposed information is normally omitted, and
 independent pronouns, which are rarely employed, have a contrastive force. (c) Only
 one piece of new information is introduced per clause. The net effect of these
 tendencies is to establish for the great majority of right-headed Papuan languages a
 structure like [(XP)V] as the normative clausal unit in wider stretches of text. (Foley
 2000: 387)
 An overt subject noun phrase is, therefore, not grammatically required in a
 clause in Oksapmin. Where the subject is fairly constant over a stretch of discourse, it
 is mentioned at the start and may not be mentioned again for some time, if at all.
 Example (10-64) below shows a stretch of discourse from a text with a subject, nox
 ‘1s’, which is mentioned in the first clause, and which is then not mentioned in the
 consecutive clauses where it is still the subject. Note also that the object plate a ima
 elel jox ‘plates and those things’ is mentioned in the second clause below (10-64)b.
 but not in the third clause (10-64)c. where it is still the object. All S, O, and Pred
 constituents are marked in the clauses below.

 (“Today” by Henna Kashat)
Note also that the temporal adverb jəxe ‘then’ occurs at the start of a clause in
example (10-64)d. and e. above. The word jəxe ‘then’ and other words with a similar
function commonly occur at the beginning of a clause with a function similar to that
of discourse markers. Unlike other non-predicate parts of the clause, these cannot
occur in other positions in the clause, at least not with the same function (see §10.3.1
below).

I will take the bulk of the evidence to show that Choctaw is not a
pronominal argument language.
3.3. Constituent ordering
Choctaw is a consistently head-final language. In the following sections,
I survey a number of syntactic environments where final position of the
head is seen.
3.3.1. Word order at the sentential level
As mentioned above, the basic word order of the language is subject-
object-verb. Verb phrases are head final, and when there are multiple
objects, there is considerable freedom in their order.

Markers of illocutionary force are discussed in more detail in chapter 12.
3.2. Configurationality
Choctaw is configurational language. The distinction between
configurational and nonconfigurational languages is due to Hale (1983,
1989), but the notion has been extended by other researchers (Speas
1990; Baker 1991) as well. As a result, the set of properties said to
characterize nonconfigurational languages differs somewhat from source
to source. Here I will look a t the following properties: nonexistence of a
verb phrase, discontinuous constituency, extensive use of null anaphora,
and extensive use of agreement morphology.
3.2.1. Configurationality and verb phrases
There are several potential arguments for the existence of a verb phrase
(VP) in Choctaw. Since the existence of a verb phrase implies a
configurational difference between subjects and objects (with object
inside the verb phrase and subject outside it), arguments for verb
phrases translate into arguments for configurationality. All the
arguments for verb phrases are somewhat theory-internal, but taken as
a group they are convincing. I will consider arguments from word order,
 Basic syntactic typology39
adverb placement, proforms, coordination, placement of certain VP-
internal items, and binding theory.
3.2.1.1. Word order
The normal word order of Choctaw is subject-object-verb. Subjects
obligatorily receive nominative case, but overt accusative case is optional
for objects.

",1,SOV,"The Choctaw language described in the grammar has the ""SVO"" (subject-verb-object) dominant word order.",SVO,1,0,
Choctaw," John-NM buy-TNSpeach-A~/?*peach
 'John bought a peach.'
There are several ways that these facts might be accounted for, but
perhaps the simplest is the following:
(49) Accusative case is optional for objects that are in situ; obligatory for
 moved objects.
But this formulation implies that subject-object-verb is the most basic
order and that other orders are derived via movement. That follows
naturally from positing a verb phrase.
3.2.1.2. Adverb placement
As is shown in more detail in chapter 18, an external temporal adverb
like pilaashaash 'yesterday' may occur sentence-initially, sentence-
finally, or between the subject and any objects. However, it may not
appear between the verb and the object:

4. The verb lexicon of Golin
 Bella Ross
This article will examine the verb lexicon of Golin. Like many other highland
languages, Golin displays a relatively small verb class. In order to express a wide
range of meanings, Golin, in addition to using independent generic verbs, makes use of
three main types of phrasal verb constructions. These include phrasal verb
constructions consisting of a coverb and an inflecting verb (hereafter, Co-V
constructions), compound and sequential verb chains.
",0,SOV,The given paragraph doesn't provide enough information about the dominant word order of the language Golin.,Not enough information,0,0,
Golin," So, the switch to third person inflection on the verb may be a pragmatic
device, as well as signalling syntactic change.
11. Mood clauses: Imperatives and Interrogatives
11.1 Imperatives
Imperatives minimally consist of a verb with an imperative inflection, with optional
nominals that follow the canonical word order of Golin clauses:
100
 5. Clause types in Golin
(67)w-a!
come-IMP
’Come!’ (1b 80)
(68)yal is-a!
man TOP hit-IMP
’Hit that man!’ (1a 24)
(69)i arikare-ki-a!
you sunsee-NEG-IMP
’Don’t look at the sun!’ (1b 94)
11.2 Interrogatives
Polar interrogatives, as shown in example (70), usually follow the canonical
word order of clauses in Golin, and have person agreement with the subject on the
verb.
",0,SOV,"Based on the given information, the language described in the grammar follows the ""canonical word order of Golin clauses"" which suggests that it has a dominant word order of Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).",SOV,0,0,порядок слов в вопросительных предложениях
Golin," Where person agreement on the verb (or lack thereof) cannot distinguish the
role of participants, word order becomes necessary to determine this. There is no case
marking for core arguments in Golin, although there may be some evidence for case
marking for instrumentals.
2. Verbless clauses
 Verbless clauses can have an attributive function, or can indicate possession.
The verbless clause consists of a subject (S), adjectival or possessive predicate, and
often a demonstrative. While the demonstrative gives deictic emphasis, it can also
function as a dummy subject.
",0,SOV,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to determine the dominant word order of the language described. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information"".",Not enough information,0,0,упоминание порядка слов
Golin," Like many Papuan languages, the canonical word order in Golin is SOV.
There is some flexibility in the position of S and O depending on the clause type (eg.
(23)), as the verb usually inflects to agree with the subject. However, with the
possible exception of some verbless clauses (see examples (2) and (6)), the predicate
always occurs in clause final position.
",1,SOV,"The dominant word order described in the grammar is SOV.",SOV,0,0,
Golin," Distinct from the basic intransitive, an adjunct nominal also occurs between
the verb and subject nominal, as shown in (13):
(13) (na)S kurulADJUNCT pri-Ø-g-eV
 (1SG) fearperceive-1SG-AS-PR
 ’I am afraid.’ (1b 36)
 From the data collected so far, it does not appear that the position of the
adjunct and S can be reversed. This distinguishes this clause type from some types of
transitive clause (section 4), where OSV order can occur (see example (23)).
It is then likely that the adjunct forms part of the verb phrase:
 [(S)NP [[ADJUNCT] VERB]VP]
 Given that Golin has only a limited number of generic, final verbs, this clause
type expresses more kinds of events and states, including attributives in (14), than the
basic intransitive clause:
(14) nanibil si-Ø-g-e
 1SG sick hit-1SG-AS-PROX
 ’I am sick.’ (1a.94)
(15) i amin di-n-g-e
 you sit be-2-AS-PROX
 ’You sit.’ (13/03/03)
 91
Section 1: Brown

 ’I talked.’ (1b 72)
(17) na ulpa-ra-Ø-g-e

(18) na tabin mile-Ø-g-e,iarawaimile-n-g-e
 1SGshort be-1SG-AS-PROX youtallbe-2-AS-PROX
 ’I am short and you are tall.’ (26/03/03)
 Also, I have chosen to represent the adjunct and verb as separate, rather than
as a bound complex, as other elements can occur between the verb and the adjunct. In
some cases this is just a negative particle, as in (19) and (22), but in (20) para ‘both’
occurs, and in (21) negative ta and the demonstrative i also intervene.
(19) [[i]S [[amin][ta] di-ki-n-g-e]PRED]
 you sitNEG be-NEG-2-AS-PROX
 ’You are not sitting.’ Cf. (15)
(20) [[iyal su]S [[ka] [para] di-n-g-e]PRED]
 you man two word both say-2-AS-PROX
 ’You two are both talking.’ Cf. (16) (1b. 107)
(21) [[na]S [[ka i] [ta] di-ki-Ø-g-a]PRED]
 1SGword TOP NEG say-NEG-1SG-AS-DIST
 ’I did not talk about that.’ Cf. (16) (1a. 73)
(22) [[na]S [[ul] [ta] pa-k-ra-Ø-g-e]PRED]
 1SGsleep NEG be-NEG-IRR-1SG-AS-PROX
 ’I will not sleep.’ Cf. (17) (1a. 44)
 It is also possible that both the adjunct and the negative particle are bound to
the verb, but this seems less likely in (21) where the demonstrative is also present.
Whether the negative particle alone is bound the verb or modifies the adjunct is also
unclear. At this stage, it is not known exactly which adjuncts can combine with which
verbs and how many combinations are possible.
4. Transitive clauses
 The transitive clause consists of a nominal agent and a nominal patient, with a
verbal predicate. The verb is always marked for the person of the agent, and the
unmarked order is SOV:
92
5. Clause types in Golin
(23) [[dekabe]S[na]O [su-n-g-w-a]V]
 mosquito1SGhit-3-AS-3-DIST
 ’The mosquito bit me.’ (1b 28)
(24) [[na]S [dekabe]O [si-Ø-ga]V]
 1SGmosquitohit-1SG-AS-DIST
 ’I killed the mosquito.’ (1b 28)
 The structure of the transitive clause is, in some circumstances, relatively free.
In (25), the patient is topicalized by being placed in clause-initial position. The agent
of the clause (1SG) is still marked on the verb, so the OSV word order is possible
without ambiguity:
(25) [yal i]O[na]S [si-Ø-g-a]V]
 3SG.M 1SG hit-1SG-AS-DIST
 ’He was hit by me.’ (1a.95)
 Additionally, the agent and patient nominals can be omitted from the clause
altogether. In (26), the agent is indicated by the pronominal verb suffix, and a patient
is understood from the semantics of the verb sige:
(26) [si-Ø-g-e]pred]
 hit-1SG-AS-PROX
 ’I hit (someone).’ (1b 71)
 It appears then that transitive clauses like (25) and (26) are arranged on a topic
first principle, with S and O nominals in apposition to the verb – a property found in
some other Papuan languages (Foley 1986).

Warembori,"2SG=chicken see 1SG=dog
‘Your chicken saw my dog.’
* ‘My dog saw your chicken.’
Pragmatic variation in word order is discussed in section 5. Given appropriate agreement
marking on the verb, however, the whole clause may be reduced to simply the verb and it’s
agreement markers. In the example below, the subject prefix and the object suffix contain
enough information that there is no (referential, non-pragmatic) need for any additional
arguments in the clause.
",1,SVO,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to confidently determine the dominant word order of the language described in the grammar.

15.2 COMPARISON WITH YOKE
Yoke appears to be the only language that is closely related to Warembori. It shares not only a
number of lexical items, displaying regular sound changes and ranges of meaning, but also a
large number of structural features (in terms of valency-altering processes, word-order typology,
and other typological characteristics).
15.2.1 Lexical comparison
On a 200-item word list the two languages share approximately 33% of basic lexical items,
allowing for a rather loose set of cognate judgements. In these words, however, we can clearly
identify regular sound correspondences, such as Warembori b for Yoke , Warembori -ti- for
Yoke -si-, and Warembori -n# for Yoke -mb#. Importantly, the languages share a lot of bound
morphology, with identical forms and functions in the two languages; examples of this include
the pronominal subject/possessive prefixes, and the object suffixes; the forms of causative and
applicative morphemes; the use of similar structures with adjectival modification; similar
prepositions).
",0,SVO,"Based on the information provided, there is not enough information to determine which dominant word order the language described in the grammar has.

13. Incorporation
Nominal incorporation is a phenomenon found in many languages filling a range of different
functions (see, for example, Mithun 1984). Warembori is unusual in that it presents two clear
examples of incorporation constructions which differ in the order that they present with respect
to the verb, one denoting purely habitual actions with non-referential nominals showing
incorporation, and the other with clearly referential nominals.
13.1 HABITUAL INCORPORATION
Certain verbs that require the presence of a particular noun in order to be accomplished may
incorporate that noun. If this is done, the noun appears in between the subject prefix and the
verb root. The incorporated nominal may be the theme, or the instrument, of the verb, as in these
following examples:
(148) E-pue-kambi.
",0,SVO,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to determine which dominant word order the language described in the grammar has. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Not enough information"".",Not enough information,0,0,
Warembori,"Wood- DEFburn not-IND
‘The wood isn’t burning.’
Negation of non-predicate items, such as ‘We saw no people’ has not been observed.
Negation of attributive elements in the NP is highly constrained; see section 7.4.1.
[a more complete sketch will include information on negating different elements
of the sentence: these just show predicates, but donÕt forget negating subjects,
obliques (itÕs not me whoÕs coming, itÕs not to Sentani that IÕm going), and time,
etc. Of course, these might be impossible to say É]
5. Pragmatic and syntactic variation
In addition to the basic morphosyntactic forms discussed in 4, there are various factors that can
influence the shape of an uttered clause in Warembori. Given the lack of a voice system in the
language, these are mainly pragmatic alternations in word order (with morphosyntactic
consequences); there are, however, two other constructions that reflect pragmatic emphasis that
are more traditionally thought of as part of the clausal morphosyntax.
5.1 FRONTING
In addition to the basic SVO word order seen in section 3.1, we also find examples with OSV
order, as below; an important difference, however, is that these sentences often involve an
intonational break between the O and the SV, which is not possible for the basic sentences (this
intonation break is indicated in the examples with a comma ‘,’, following normal orthographic

 11 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS
11.6 FURTHER DISCUSSION
11.6.1 NO MARKED FOCUS
Not all Lavukaleve sentences have marked focus; in fact only about a third do. Under
LambrechtÕs analysis, all sentences convey information; they all have information
structure, and thus they all have focus. This is certainly true for Lavukaleve, as for all
languages. The above analysis has suggested that are two types of sentences in
Lavukaleve: those with grammatical focus constructions, and those without. By this,
however, it should not be understood that those sentences which do not employ a focus
construction do not have focus. Rather, in those sentences which do not employ focus
constructions, speakers are still conveying information about something; they are still
dividing their speech into presupposition and assertion; but they are not making this
distinction grammatically overt in the way a focus construction does. In other languages
with grammatically marked focus systems, for example Somali (Saeed 1984), the focus
system is likewise not used in every single sentence of the language.
If one thinks for a moment of focus constructions like LavukaleveÕs, or SomaliÕs, as
operating in a broadly similar functional domain as, for example, cleft constructions in
English (although LavukaleveÕs focus system and English clefts are very different types
of phenomena; see next section), then one can more easily understand why they are not
used for every sentence. In English, every sentence has information structure, but only
some have cleft constructions to make overt this information structure. In Lavukaleve, an
equivalent situation obtains, although the proportion of sentences with focus
constructions is far higher, corresponding to their considerably wider syntactic
possibilities, than clefts in English.
11.6.2 DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FOCUS MARKERS AND COPULAS
Sentence-Internal focus constructions share many similarities with cleft constructions in
other languages. Functionally, they often serve to express the same kinds of pragmatic
meanings as cleft constructions with copulas do in languages that have them (see e.g.
Stenson (1981) on Irish). They serve to mark focus on a particular argument, and,
especially when the Sentence-Internal focus marker occurs in construction with a
constituent at the start of the sentence, one could interpret the Sentence-Internal focus
constituent as a copula clause, at the front of, and in construction with, the main clause.
However Lavukaleve focus markers cannot be analysed as copulas.
The focus marker is not obligatory in non-verbal predications. All the examples given
above could equally well appear without the focus marker. The distribution of focus
markers in non-verbal clauses is identical to their distribution in verbal clauses. In both
cases, it is pragmatic factors of focus marking which determine whether these words will
appear in a clause or not; whether the clause is verbal or non-verbal is irrelevant. Rather,
non-verbal clauses, like verbal clauses, may or may not be grammatically marked for
280
 11 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS
focus, and thus can appear with or without the focus marker, on those grounds alone.
There are two further major syntactic objections to treating the focus markers as copulas.
The first is that normally, the constituent which the focus marker is in construction with
does not move to the front of the sentence. Instead it stays in its place within the clause.
The focus marker appears immediately after it. Consider the following example:
81)Airala umalauouvikola fivonorevhiv.
 airala umalauouvikola fivo- nore -vhiv
 woman(f) sgfArtkumara(m) and cassava(m) 3plFOC 3sgS- plant -pl 3plEFOC
 The woman planted kumara and cassava.e2 014b
It is possible to say umalau o uvikola fiv, aira la onorev hiv, but usually people
donÕt. They leave the focussed constituent in place in the clause. The fact that these
focussed constituents are not extracted makes a cleft analysis problematic.
There is a further problem with analysing Lavukaleve focus markers as copulas, even if
one does not argue that sentences like these are clefts. If one argues that the Sentence-
Internal focus marker is a copula, then one would be forced to say that in Lavukaleve it is
possible to intersperse a main clause with an embedded copula clause. That is, in the
above example (81), one would have to say that umalau o uvikola fiv is a copula
clause, embedded in the sentence aira la onorev hiv. These objections make very
unattractive the analysis that clauses with Sentence-Internal focus markers are copula
clauses.
11.6.3 FOCUS SYSTEM VERSUS ALIGNMENT SYSTEM
It is possible to be misled by the agreement patterns of the Agreement Suffix on the verb
and the focus marker into thinking that they form part of a syntactic alignment system.
Consider for example, that in positive clauses the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus
marker generally agree with O of a transitive clause and S of an intransitive clause; and
that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker agree with A/S in negative clauses.
This phenomenon might suggest that the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker are
actually forming part of a split-ergative agreement system determined on purely syntactic
principles. There are a number of reasons why this analysis would be unsatisfactory.
Firstly, not all positive clauses have the verbal Agreement Suffix and focus marker
agreeing with O; sometimes they agree with A. So one would have to find syntactic
reasons why in these cases agreement was with A, not O. One could argue that the split-
ergative system was based on partially syntactic and partially pragmatic principles; and
this kind of system does occur (rarely) in the languages of the world (see e.g. Dixon
1994: 211). But such an analysis would fail to account for the pragmatic function of the
focus marker in the sentences in which it occurs; and it would miss the generalisation that
the agreement of the focus marker (and verbal Agreement Suffix) can be predicted without
 281
 11 - FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONS
exception by knowing which part of a sentence is being focussed on.9
11.6.4 A TYPOLOGICAL NOTE
Lambrecht and Polinsky (1997) propose some typological universals with respect to the
grammatical encoding of sentence focus. They argue that there is a formal, paradigmatic
relationship between predicate focus and sentence focus constructions in languages:
Ò[sentence focus] constructions have the form they do because they are to be minimally
distinct from corresponding [predicate focus] constructions within a given languageÓ
(Lambrecht and Polinsky 1997: 191).
As a corollary of this, as sentence focus involves lack of a topic-comment structure, it is
important that the subject of a sentence focus construction must be marked in such a way
that it cannot be interpreted as a topic; thus, Ò[sentence focus] marking crucially involves
DETOPICALIZATION of the nominal constituents involvedÓ (p. 191). This detopicalisation can
be accomplished in one of two ways: either by cancelling formal properties typically
associated with topic arguments; or by coding the subject of a sentence focus construction
formally in a way typically associated with focus arguments. This leads to their Principle
of Subject-Object Neutralisation, which says that subjects of sentence focus constructions
are grammatically coded with properties typically associated with objects; and their
Principle of Topic Cancellation, which says that the subject of a sentence focus sentence
cannot be coded in a similar formal way to topics.
In English, sentence focus is marked formally by a prosodic accent on the subject NP.
This marking type, they say, comes about through paradigmatic opposition to predicate
focus marking in English, in which the prosodic accent is on the object: Òthe position of
the accent on the subject noun in the [sentence focus] construction is the result purely of a
formal requirement: the need to indicate a paradigmatic contrastÓ (p. 195). They present a
typology of formal marking of sentence focus, as opposed to predicate focus: sentence
focus marking in a given language may involve prosodic inversion, that is, giving the
sentence focus subject the prosodic accent usually associated with an object (or predicate);
changes to linear order; making the subject a single constituent within the predicate
(syntactic inversion); making the subject a non-topic; giving it non-nominative case
marking; or giving the verb impersonal agreement. Lavukaleve does not fit with any of
these formal marking strategies, but even though the material it uses to mark sentence
focus versus predicate focus is not covered in Lambrecht and PolinskyÕs typology, the
system it uses to mark the opposition between sentence focus and predicate focus is
exactly parallel to those used in many other languages.
That is, focus marker agreement in sentence focus and predicate focus constructions in

Note that a split-ergative system does exist elsewhere in Lavukaleve. In subordinate adverbial clauses
first and second person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system, and third
person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system: see Section 16.1.

CHAPTER NINE
Overview of clause structure, predicate
types and core participant marking
The aims of this chapter are twofold. The first part of this chapter describes and justifies
the theoretical premises on which the analysis of the syntactic structures of Lavukaleve
is founded, and outlines the grammatical terminology used in this thesis. In addition,
there is a discussion of which arguments are core arguments and how they are
expressed.
Secondly, the chapter provides a brief overview of clause structure, constituent order,
predicate types and core participant marking, in order to enable the reader to parse
sentences in the rest of the description without necessarily having read every word of
the grammar. As these parts of the chapter are intended as an overview, structures are
discussed briefly, with cross-references to detailed discussions of each construction type
elsewhere in the thesis.
9.1 BASIC CLAUSE STRUCTURE
Basic clauses in Lavukaleve consist maximally of a predicate, which is the head of the
clause, two core NPs (subject and object arguments of the predicate), and any number
of adjuncts, which may be various types of nominal adjuncts, adverbs or particles.
There are no verbs whose argument structure requires an adjunct, although there are
many verbs which commonly appear with adjuncts.
9.2 CONSTITUENT ORDER
The predicate is typically the final constituent of the clause (see below for a definition
205
9 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURE
of predicates; prototypically, it means a verb, or anything that acts like a verb). Core
NPs precede the verb; if there are two, the subject must precede the object. There is thus
a fairly strict constituent order for basic Lavukaleve clauses: SOV (or, using DixonÕs
(1979) syntactic primitives, which are introduced below, SV/AOV).
Adjuncts may appear anywhere between these NPs and the predicate, although they
may not intervene between elements of the NP. A textual example of a near-maximal
clause:
1)[Aka] [taragaunane ruia la][nikol]
aka taragau nane ruia la nikol
thensea.eagle(m)sgmArtwith old.woman(f) sgfArt first
[tail fi] [lovolorihi].
tailfilo-volori-¿hi
house(n)3sgnFOC 3duS-make -sgn 3sgnEFOC
So the sea eagle and the woman built a house first.gm 046
In example (1) above, constituents are separated with square brackets. There are two
NPs; taragau na ne ruia la, the subject; and tail fi, the object (with a focus marker).
The predicate is lovolori hi (with a focus marker), and there are two adjuncts, both
particles, aka and nikol. Focus markers can occur at the end of any type of constituent;
they are a ubiquitous feature of Lavukaleve syntax, and it is almost impossible to quote
an example without at least one focus marker in it; indeed it would be misleading to try.
For a discussion of the morpho-pragmatics of focus marking in Lavukaleve, see Chapter
11.
Most clauses in Lavukaleve, however, consist of many fewer elements than this
maximal pattern implies; indeed there is no example in the corpus of a maximal clause
as outlined above. The only obligatory constituent of a clause is the predicate; all other
members are optional, and in particular, core NPs are often not present in clauses. Basic
clauses, then, typically consist of a predicate, preceded by some adjuncts, and possibly
one or more NPs. A textual example of a more typical type of clause structure:
2)[ Kini] [ngoham][fo'sal][voakuru].
kiningo- hamfo'salvo-a- kuru
ACT 2sg- forfish(pl)3plO-1sgS-hit
I'll go catch some fish for you. gm 037
In this example, there is an adjunct, kini, followed by another adjunct, ngoham,
followed by an object NP, fo'sal , followed by the predicate, voakuru.
It was stated above that there was a fairly strict constituent order SV/AOV. This is for
the most part true; if both subject and object NPs occur before the predicate, they must
occur in that order, and usually the predicate is the final element of the sentence.
However it is not unknown for one of the NPs, usually the subject NP, to appear after
the predicate. If this does happen, there is almost always an intonation break between
206
9 - O VERVIEW OF CLAUSE S TRUCTURE
the predicate and the NP. Many such constructions seem to be repair constructions, in
which the speaker, having omitted to mention the NP subject overtly, then wonders
whether the hearer understood it properly, and adds it in as an afterthought.

fova me- kelei -nlei-vuke lei-vhova
PN.PROX.pl 1plin- near -LOC exist -pl near exist -pl MOD.PROX.pl
They're close to us. Close to us.ja 143
At first sight these appear to be examples of an NP appearing after the verb, in
contradiction to the constituent-order generalisation made in Section 9.2 that constituent
order is SV/AOV. However, a better analysis is possible.
Firstly, the only NPs which can appear in this position are demonstrative modifiers. No
other NP types can do this. Secondly, the verb of such clauses always involves the
Agreement Suffix. Thirdly, the demonstrative and Agreement Suffix always agree. These
points suggest that the demonstrative in such constructions is in fact functioning as a
focus marker, in a Sentence-Final focus construction. There is some deep overlap
between focus markers and deictics, as evidenced by the relationship between f- and h-
stems in both demonstratives and focus markers (see Section 11.7.1), and in these
constructions it seems that the demonstrative is functioning as a focus marker.
Note that in such examples, the hoia demonstrative modifier is used. It is not possible for
a demonstrative pronoun (that is, a demonstrative from the foia or oia paradigms) to
occur in this function. Further, hoia cannot have a head in such situations:
67) *Ami okivfo'sal hoiva?
amio- ki -vfo'sal hoiva
who(m) 3sgS- shoot -pl fish(pl)MOD.MED.pl
Who shot these fish? e4 013b
The fact that hoia in these situations cannot take a head noun shows that it is indeed
acting in a manner very different from its normal syntactic function, and lends support to
the idea that it is functioning here as a focus marker rather than a demonstrative modifier.
11.5 MORE THAN ONE FOCUS MARKER IN ONE SENTENCE
It is very common in Lavukaleve for more than one focus marker to occur in one
sentence. There are two types of construction which need to be discussed in this respect.

3 - WORD C LASSES
Place nouns can function as nominal adjuncts with no morphological marking. All place
nouns are proper names, but not all proper names are place nouns; some are common
nouns, some are locational nouns.
Both locational nouns and place nouns can be modified by adjectives and
demonstratives, and they have inherent gender.
Nominal adjuncts, including those formed with common nouns in postpositional
phrases, with locational nouns using the Locative (and Perlative) suffixes, and with
place nouns are discussed in Chapter 7.
There are three genders in Lavukaleve: masculine, feminine and neuter, named for the
fact that in the masculine class belong (among other things) most nouns referring to
male people, in the feminine class belong (among other things) all nouns referring to
female people, and in the neuter class belong very few nouns referring to humans.
Nouns have a fixed gender, which controls agreement with its modifiers, and
throughout the clause. Note that there are a few nouns which are always plural. Because
plural nouns do not have gender, this means that, strictly speaking, there are some nouns
which do not have inherent gender. Such nouns are considered a special case of
common nouns; the phenomenon is more to do with morphological exigencies of
Lavukaleve than with the syntactic distribution of such words. The principles associated
with gender assignment are discussed in Chapter 6.
3.2 VERBS
Verbs have the following syntactic and morphological features:
·they function as argument-taking predicates
·they can take subject prefixes, and object prefixes if transitive
·they can take the Agreement Suffix to agree with their nominal arguments
·they can take TAM suffixes
·they can take the Nominaliser suffix -e ~ -i (they have to be nominalised in order to
 function as head of an NP)
· they can take the Locativiser suffix -l
There are three subtypes of verbs, defined on the basis of their primary valency.
Intransitive verbs take only one argument (subject). Transitive verbs take two
arguments (subject and object). Ambitransitive verbs can take either one or two
arguments, with no overt valency-changing morpheme to mark the change of
transitivity (though the appearance of object affixation makes the transitivity clear).
There are no ditransitive verbs in Lavukaleve (see Chapter 9.3.2 for argumentation for
this claim), and there are no verbs with zero valency. All verb stems are vowel-final.

Lavukaleve,"11
1 - I NTRODUCTION
large number of minor classes, including adjectives, demonstratives, pronouns, focus
markers, postpositions, conjunctions, the Habitual Auxiliary, locationals, demonstrative
identifiers and verb adjuncts. There is a definite article, unlike in almost all Papuan
languages. It is marked for gender and number, and is the final member of a noun
phrase. Many of the Oceanic languages of the Solomon Islands have definite articles,
but they precede, rather than follow, their noun.
Nouns are divided into three genders. This is a feature common in languages of the East
Papuan Phylum, and rare in Oceanic languages. Gender in Lavukaleve is marked in
agreement forms on all noun modifiers, and on verbs through participant marking
prefixes and suffixes. Gender distinctions are maintained in singular and dual forms
throughout all areas of the language, but are collapsed in the plural. Nouns are overtly
marked for number, and the methods of marking number are highly complex and
irregular. There are up to 80 different ways of creating dual and plural forms of nouns.
Plural formation depends largely on phonological and semantic criteria, and also bears
some relationship to gender. Dual formation operates on different principles, largely
depending on the phonological shape of the singular noun. There is case marking for
three spatial/relational cases, but these have a low functional load. Possession is marked
by a prefix on the possessed noun. Types of possession are undifferentiated, as in most
Papuan languages, as opposed to Oceanic languages, in which possession is frequently a
very complex area. In Oceanic languages, possessive affixes are frequently the same as
object affixes; in Lavukaleve, all but one are identical to subject affixes. Like in most
Papuan languages, but unlike in Oceanic languages, all modifiers follow their head
noun.
Deictics are a highly elaborated feature of Lavukaleve. There are personal pronouns for
1st and 2nd persons, but not for 3rd person. The functional domain of personal
pronouns in the 3rd person is filled instead by a demonstrative modifier, and two
demonstrative pronouns, all three of which are marked for gender, number and three
degrees of distance from the speaker, with a further distinction made in the distal
category between specific and non-specific location. The two demonstrative pronouns
differ solely in terms of their discourse pragmatics. One is used for a referent which is
uppermost in the minds of speaker and addressee. The other is used for a referent who
was referred to previously but who is not the last referent to have been mentioned. This
demonstrative is used to switch attention between more than one referent in a discourse.
The demonstrative modifier and this demonstrative pronoun, along with various other
spatial deictics, have derived presentative forms, and also derived predicative forms.
There is also a set of demonstrative identifiers which occur in a similar functional
domain to the deictic predicates.
Verbs are the most morphologically complex of Lavukaleve words. Person, gender,
number and syntactic role (subject and object) are marked by two prefix slots, and
suffixes mark tense, aspect, mood and derivational categories such as causative,
reciprocal, locativisation, nominalisation, intransitivisation, and intensity. There are also
 12
1 - I NTRODUCTION
three categories of subordination, as well as other categories including negation and
extendedness, which can be marked by verbal suffixes. Verbs can also take a suffix to
mark the gender and number of one participant. This gender/number marking is used to
mark the subject of stative/resultative intransitive verbs (as opposed to active
intransitive verbs which use a verbal subject prefix to cross-reference their subject), and
occurs also on the verbs of relative clauses and focus constructions.
Complex predicates are extremely common, and consist of verb-plus-auxiliary
structures, serial verb constructions, and, to a much lesser extent, verb-adjunct
combinations. Serial verb constructions are common in both Papuan and Oceanic
languages, and adjunct constructions are well known in Papuan languages. Lavukaleve
however does not make extensive use of either, preferring separate clauses for
combining predicates and other expressions in general for common collocations.
Like many Papuan languages, one of the methods Lavukaleve uses to combine
predicates is clause chaining. There are three verbal suffixes used in clause chains,
which indicate the temporal relationship of the chained clause to the following clause.
However, unusually for a language which has clause chaining, there is no switch-
reference marking, and indeed there are no restrictions on argument sharing between
chained clauses. Subordination is also a very frequent method of clause combining, and
there are a few different semantic types of subordinate clauses. While in almost all areas
of its morpho-syntax Lavukaleve is a nominative/accusative language, adverbial
subordinate clauses involve a split-ergative marking system in which first and second
person subjects follow a nominative/accusative participant marking system whereas
third person subjects follow an ergative/absolutive marking system. Relative clauses are
internally-headed; their heads are syntactically part of the relative clause, not the main
clause.
Constituent order in Lavukaleve is fixed: SV/AOV. Departures from this norm are rare;
an argument which is an afterthought can be postposed. Preposing and postposing for
emphasis do not occur in Lavukaleve; these pragmatic functions are carried out instead
by focus constructions.
Focus is a central part of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax. It is heavily grammaticalised into
clause structure, and extremely frequent in discourse. Roughly one third of all clauses
have some kind of grammatical focus construction. Any constituent can be focussed,
including NPs, postpositional phrases and other nominal adjuncts, adverbs, predicates
(either just a verb, or a verb with its object), subordinate clauses, the lexical part of a
complex predicate, or indeed whole sentences. There are two different kinds of
syntactic focus construction, one with the verb in a special form, used to mark focus on
predicates (verb plus object) or whole sentences, and one without this special verb form,
used for focussing on arguments, adjuncts and non-main verbal forms. In both
construction types, focus is marked by special particles, which occur immediately after
the focussed constituent and show agreement in person, gender and number. The scope
 13
 1 - I NTRODUCTION
of the focus is indicated by the agreement of the focus marker. There are three separate
paradigms of focus markers, which differ in terms of the sentence type with which they
occur. One is used only in polar questions; one in content questions and environments
expressing particular kinds of emphasis; the third is used elsewhere.
There is a deep relationship between deictics and focus markers involving, among other
things, a system of alliterative discord, a type of agreement system in which the form of
a deictic in a focus construction requires the form of the focus marker to disagree with it
in its initial consonant.
Focus marking and deictics are the most highly elaborated areas of Lavukaleve morpho-
syntax, and indeed the largest chapters of this description are devoted to these. In these
areas Lavukaleve finds grammatical expression of discourse-pragmatic domains of
focus, emphasis and activation. Indeed, as is clear from the description to follow, it is
not possible to explicate the basic morpho-syntax of Lavukaleve without making
constant reference to these pragmatic domains.

WORD FORMATION
Santa preserves the basic functional and morphological dichotomy between nouns
(nominals) and verbs (verbals). Derived nominal and verbal stems are produced by deriv-
ative suffixes, many of which are of Common Mongolic origin, while others have been
borrowed from local Chinese. Some suffixes have more than one shape for performing a
single function because of the rudimental vowel harmony, still occasionally observed in
the suffixation process. Another factor causing suffix allomorphy is that the liquids r and l

The connective case can be used both adnominally and adverbially. In adnominal use
it expresses a variety of attributive (genitival) relations, including possession, subject,
object, time, space, origin, or material, e.g. Yusufu-ni jien ‘Joseph’s clothes’, yeye-ni

wood’. Occasionally, such phrases can come close to the status of a compound word by
dropping the case marker, e.g. ghon usu ‘valley-water’, muzha shire ‘wooden desk’. In
adverbal use the connective expresses the direct object (accusative), e.g. ene shu-ni nie
onshi ‘read this book’. Often this objective marker is dropped, especially when the object
is indefinite, e.g. shu onshi ‘read [some] books!’.

ing as the grammatical subject and occupying the initial position in the sentence, can also
be formed by using the borrowed passivizer ne.yi- ‘to be affected, to receive’ (from

5.3 Use of Clauses
5.3.1 Word Order
 The syntactic structure of a Wand Tuan clause carries semantic information in a communication situation. As
was noted in the typological discussion in the Introduction, the basic word order for a Wand Tuan clause is S-O-V.
While this is the basic word order, it is not as inflexible as is the word order of English. On the other hand, neither is
it as free as Yimas for which there are apparently “…no syntactic rules necessary to produce a sentence” (Foley,
1986:170).
",1,SOV,"The language described in the grammar has a dominant word order of ""SOV"" (Subject-Object-Verb).",SOV,0,0,
Kamasau," In transitive clauses, the verb morphology marks both the subject and the object. It may not be necessary for
any particular clause to manifest those participants by surface-level nominals, if they are apparent from the context.
While the nominal (or a substitute pronominal) may not be always necessary, the word order is important. The order
in which the clause tagmemes occur conveys semantic information.
",0,SOV,"Based on the given information, it is not clear what is the dominant word order of the language described in the grammar. The paragraph does not provide any explicit information on whether the language has a dominant word order. Hence, the answer is ""Not enough information."".",Not enough information,0,0,упоминание порядка слов
Kamasau," The most distinctive phonological difference between the dialects is that the [s]/[t] contrast in the segi and
soigi dialects is reduced to [h] and [t] in the hagi and ghini dialects respectively. See the following comparison:
segi soigi hagi ghini
kaskas kahkat ‘I sit’
su suhu tu‘fingernail’
wetwet wehwet ‘stone’
tumo tumohumo tumo‘tail’
Another phonological distinction is that glottal stops (symbolized ‘q’) are lost in the ghini dialect. For example:
segi soigihagighini
guqodguqodguqod guod‘I see’
mueq mueq mueqmue ‘saucepan’

 Lexicostatistically Wand Tuan groups into three major dialects: hagi, segi/soigi, and ghini.
1.2.2 Knowledge of Other Languages
 At least 90% of the population are bilingual in Wand Tuan and Tok Pisin, and about 40-50% speak and
understand English to some extent. Approximately 5-8% speak Tok Pisin as their primary language with only a
passive comprehension of Wand Tuan.
1.2.3 A Typological Sketch
 Wand Tuan is basically a SOV language (contra Foley, 1986:105, 241). C.f., the following:
 1) joe2:17
 Quayi nungoqi umbo ngamo te w- awo.
 man2pstomach holedem 2p- put.p
 subj objverb
 ‘You men dig the toilets.’
 2) joe1:10
 quayiniwand quari m -e -m
 man3s/p talkstory 3mp- give -3mp
 subj ioobjverb
 ‘…the men give some stories to them.’
 It is possible to change the order of the clause constituents for pragmatic reasons, placing a component other
than Subject in the Topic position, as in the following.
 3) joe5:29
 Pudinyombui rennungoqi newutariwo…
 pudinyombui rennungoqi new- uta*i -r-w- o
 but dog dem.3fp 2p Lim 2p- take -3fp-3fp- go
 conjobj-Topicsubjverb
 ‘But these dogs, you yourselves (cannot) take.’
 Consistent with being an SOV language, Wand Tuan is primarily postpositional. The postposition pe,
Adjectives, Relative Clauses, Demonstratives, and Numerals all follow the Head which they modify.
 4) bajyumbui
 house big
 ‘big house’
 5) baj pe (k- o)
 house to (1s- go)
 ‘I go to the house.’
 6) wuti baj pe n-as kin te
 man house at 3ms- sit rel dem
 ‘the man who is in the house’
sketch.doc, June 1994, Reprinted March 1997
Kamasau (Wand Tuan) Grammar Page 6
Introduction
7) baj wen
 house dem.3fs
 ‘this house’
8) baj teri
 house two.f
 ‘two houses’
 The one exception to the postpositional word order that one would expect of an SOV language is that the
genitive precedes the noun Head.
9) nge yir
 1s spear
 ‘my spear’
 10) ange1:11
 Morisning baj
 Maurice poss house
 ‘Maurice’s house’
 11) amu2:47
 nikin tiqe
 3s/prefl village
 ‘his own village’
 The normal order of occurrence of these modifiers is genitive (phrase), noun, adjective, numeral and
demonstrative.
 12) nge nyombui wotemi men
 1s dogchild two.m dem.m
 ‘these two small dogs of mine’
 The fact that Wand Tuan is SOV and postpositional with the genitive preceding the noun is not unheard of (cf,
Hawkins, 1983:26, 135).
",1,SOV,"The language described in the grammar has a dominant word order of SOV, which means that the verb usually comes last in a sentence.",SOV,0,0,
Kamasau," The object and location tagmemes may be forefronted for emphasis.
244) amu4:19 (obj: RedupP + sub: noun + pred: GenericVP)
 yumbo yumbo wute dro mand,
 thing thing person draw 3mp_do
 “different things the people draw,”
245) ignas2:16 (time: time word + loc: locative word + obj: noun + pred: GenericVP)
 Muqdi vende+ne irembo wasebade,
 nowDem +Lim bandicoot fire 1p_cook
 “Now let’s cook the bandicoot HERE,”
 While clause-level tagmemes may be permuted for pragmatic reasons, over 93% of the clauses in the data have
the unmarked word order. The 7% that have a marked order are evenly distributed in terms of where they occur in
sentences, paragraphs and discourses (i.e., initially, medially or finally).
5.1.3 Ditransitive Clause (DitrCl)
 The Ditransitive Clause is structurally like the transitive clause except that the indirect object is inserted
between the subject and object tagmemes. The normal order of tagmemes in ditransitive clauses is:
[time] (sub) (io) (obj) [inst] [loc] pred
 The predicate is the only obligatory tagmeme. The verb manifesting predicate in a ditransitive clause is often
the same verb as would occur in transitive clauses, except that the core nominals indexed in the verb morphology
are different. Whereas the transitive manifestation of these verbs indexes the subject and object, the ditransitive
sketch.doc, June 1994, Reprinted March 1997
Kamasau (Wand Tuan) GrammarPage 43
Clause
manifestation indexes the subject and indirect object, and optionally the object also. The nominal subject and
indirect object, when manifested, agree in person, number, and noun class with the subject and indirect object
indexed in the verb morphology.
",1,SOV,"Based on the information provided, the language described in the grammar has the ""SVO"" (Subject-Verb-Object) word order as the dominant order.",SVO,1,0,
Kamasau," Examples 271 and 273 are in the normal word order. By contrast, the order of examples 272 and 274 are O-S-
V. In example 272 the fact that the subject pronominal (ni) is manifested and is withheld from its normal initial
position, combined with phonological stress on that nominal, places it in focus. The implication is that the tree is a
given in the context, and that the speaker is denying responsibility for the felling of the tree.
271) (subject + object + predicate)
 Ni nyumo eneri
 ni nyumo e<n>eri
 3s/p tree<3ms>fell.ms
 “He felled the tree...”
272) (object + subject + predicate)
 Nyumo ni eneri
 nyumo ni e<n>eri
 tree3s/p <3ms>fell.ms
 “He felled the tree...”
 In example 274 the object nominal is modified by a demonstrative. The fact that it is modified by a
demonstrative, that it is forefronted and that it receives phonological stress places the object in focus. That is, “It is
this tree that he felled, as opposed to some other tree.” In both 272 and 274 the object is topic. The difference
between the two is which element, subject or object, is in focus.
273) (subject + object + predicate)
 Ni nyumo nen eneri
 ni nyumo nen e<n>eri
 3s/p treeDem <3ms>fell.ms
 “He felled this tree...”

Kamasau (Wand Tuan) Grammar Page 47
Clause
274) (object + subject + predicate)
 Nyumo nen ni eneri
 nyumo nen ni e<n>eri
 tree Dem 3s/p <3ms>fell.ms
 “This tree (is the one) he felled...”
 The following examples further demonstrate this principle. Example 275 is the normal way to say “He killed
the pig”. Example 276 adds another semantic component by inserting the conjunction di ‘and’. While the normal
semantic meaning of di is ‘and’, in this marked situation it conveys a causal sense. Example 277 denies
responsibility of the speaker for the death of the pig, by emphasizing that ni ‘he’ killed it.

Moses Dirks has checked all the examples, but the responsibility
for possible mistakes rests with me.
Junior Dictionary
The Junior Dictionary contains 1,500 main entries with one or
more derived forms listed under each main entry bringing the
total to about 2,500 entries. Moses Dirks selected all of the
entries in this dictionary, choosing words that are commonly
used by the young people of Atka today.
The dictionary is based upon the National Bilingual Materials
Development Center's talking pictionary of approximately 500
entries, which was compiled by Nadesta Golley and Moses Dirks,
and on Knut Bergsland's manuscript vocabulary (about 5,000
entries), which was compiled with the help of the people of Atka
in 1950, 1952, 1971, and 1973. A few words were also added
from joint work done by Bergsland and Dirks in 1976 in Oslo,
and in 1977 in Atka village.
Entries are made in alphabetical order with basic words listed
flush with the left margins of the pages. These are followed by
English translations. Derived words are listed under the basic
words followed by their English translations. Then one or more
sentences using basic words, and/or any of their derived forms
are given as examples of usage. All Native language materials is
underlined.
[]
An Aleut word is very often used both as a noun and as a verb;
therefore, the distinction is made only in the English translation
and by the choice of forms.
The following notes on the pronunciation of Atkan Aleut should
be of great help to users of this work. They have been taken
largely from material prepared for the Center by Bergsland and
Dirks in the summer of 1977.

Introduction
This publication in Atkan Aleut, commonly referred to as
Western Aleut, is one of ten similar projects undertaken by the
National Bilingual Materials Development Center. It consists of
two major sections: the Elements of Atkan Aleut Grammar and
the Junior Dictionary.
The Elements of Atkan Aleut Grammar
The Elements of Grammar section was written by Knut Bergsland
in July of 1977. Bergsland had this to say of the introduction to
Atkan Aleut grammar:
This is a teacher's aid, rather than a complete grammar. The
purpose is to make the Aleut speaking teacher aware of how the
language ""operates"", in order that it may be cultiviated in its
own right: according to its own rules, which sometimes differ
rather deeply from English. The true cultivation of the language,
however, goes through careful speech with a clear thought and
through creative writing.
The headings indicate the respective subject matters, but there
is no technical terminology, only examples to show how words
and sentences are formed and ""twisted"". To simplify the
exposition, some of the examples are rather schematic:
illustrations of rules, rather than models of style.
Some of the material may have an archaic flavor to it,
originating from my work with the people of Atka as far back as
in 1950 and 1952. The rest is based upon work done in 1971,
when I continued my own scientific work, and in 1973, when I
had the privilege of assisting the Bilingual Program, giving back
some of what I had gotten in the previous years, as well as in
1976, when Moses Dirks was with me in Oslo, Norway, and now,
in 1977, when we have been working together in Atka village.

Kuna," ‗We talked about what you said.‘
Word order dictates that the subject matter of the conversation comes after the person spoken to and before the
verb.
Examples
 1. An saglabak pegin chunmas.",0,SOV,"Based on the given paragraph, it is not clear which language is being described, so it is not possible to determine the dominant word order of the language. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information"".",Not enough information,0,0,порядок глагола и темы
Kuna," ‗I am going tomorrow.‘
If there is more than one adverbial expression occurring after the subject, the time expression occurs
immediately following the subject. This word order is different from English word order.
Example Antin pan negzhe ne.",0,SOV,"Based on the given paragraph, we cannot determine the dominant word order of the language described in the grammar. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information"".",Not enough information,0,0,порядок субъекта и обстоятельства времени
Kuna,"‗I do not know.‘
7. Word order
The normal word order in Kuna is subject + object + predicate.
ExampleOmedin we mol pakcha.",1,SOV,"Based on the information provided, the dominant word order in Kuna appears to be SVO (subject-verb-object).",SVO,1,0,
Kuna,"‗Tomorrow I want to harvest corn.‘
3.4.3 Intransitive sentence word order
In Kuna, the normal word order for an intransitive sentence is subject, then predicate. This is similar to the word
order in intransitive sentences in English.
Example
Subject Predicate
Anabarmane.
",0,SOV,"Based on the example given in the paragraph, the language described in the grammar has a dominant word order of ""SVO"" (Subject-Verb-Object). Therefore, the normal word order for a transitive sentence is subject followed by verb and then object.",SVO,1,0,порядок слов для непереходных глаголов
Kuna,"‗The woman cooked food.‘
10.4.10 Adverbs (Ex. 17–18)
Adverbs in Kuna, as in English, modify the verb; but their position in the sentence is different from English
word order. In Kuna, they occur after the subject and before the indirect or direct object: subject + adverb +
indirect object + direct object + verb.
Subtle nuances of meaning are achieved by changing this basic word order and are discussed in later lessons.
Example
Pab pirkin machi pilal.",1,SOV,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the dominant word order of the language described in the grammar is ""SVO"" (Subject-Verb-Object).",SVO,1,0,
Kuna," Consequently singularidentical in form with the active participle

Carib," The order of word units in sentences consisting of more than one word unit will
not be discussed any further in this part of the grammar dealing with sentences,
since it is largely dependent on non-sentential and non-linguistic factors (like rheto-
ric, style, logic, etc.). In the following sections 2.20 – 2.24, the discussion will be
limited to the structure of the five Carib word units themselves.
2.20 Noun units
A noun unit is a word unit interpreted to indicate an entity. A noun unit may consist
of one or more of the following constituents:
177
Of course, these examples are far from prototypical word units. In fact, one could say they
aren’t even words, but just reduced forms of words: m from him, re from are, s from is. But I
can’t think of any better English examples of bound word units.
(a) a pronoun,
(b) a numeral,
(c) an adnominal adjective unit,
(d) a noun or a combination of a possessive form of a noun preceded by a pro-
nominal prefix or a noun unit.
noun unit may be interpreted as the subject or object in a sentence. In the follow-
examples, the noun unit may be interpreted as the subject of kynuwatàton ‘they
 l dance’.
mòkaronkynuwatàton
mòkaronky- ni- uwa -tàton
thosealleg- aeo- dance -Tfutpl
‘those (people) will dance’
oko kynuwatàton

‘two (people) will dance’
tawàporamon kynuwatàton
ty- awàpo -ramonky- ni- uwa -tàton
3aml- happiness -Amaplalleg- aeo- dance -Tfutpl
‘happy (people) will dance’
pitanikonkynuwatàton
pitani -kon ky- ni- uwa -tàton
child -pln alleg- aeo- dance -Tfutpl
‘children will dance’
mòkaron oko tawàporamonpitanikonkynuwatàton
mòkaron oko ty- awàpo -ramon pitani -konky- ni- uwa -tàton
thosetwo 3aml- happiness -Amapl child -plnalleg- aeo- dance -Tfutpl
‘those two happy children will dance’
 here is a string of words in a noun unit, we can note the following general obser-
 ion about the order of those words: the more inherently the meaning of a word
 ongs to the entity described, the more word unit final that word is likely to be, the
th of which may be seen in the last example given above.178
As noted before (see 2.9 and note 130), in this book, the morpheme -no which is suffixed
adjectives, is interpreted as an adnominalizing suffix, not a nominalizing suffix. The fact
t, in a Carib noun unit, the word containing the suffix -no always precedes a noun instead
 In contrast with this observation, the word amu ‘a’, which often is noun unit
initial, may be found to be noun unit final. The difference seems to be that a noun
unit initial amu functions like an indefinite article preceding a count noun, while a
noun unit final amu indicates indifference regarding both a count noun and a mass
noun. Examples:
 amu tuna ‘a river’
 amu wokyry ‘a certain man’
 tuna amu ‘some water, it does not matter what kind or how much’
 wokyry amu ‘some man, it does not matter much who he is’
In a noun unit that indicates a plurality, a pronoun shows its plural form, but a noun
often does not, and an adjective usually shows its plural form, although there are
exceptions. The following noun units show word combinations with (a) no plural
forms, (b) only plural forms, (c) a plural pronoun and adjective and a singular noun,
(d) a plural pronoun and noun and a singular adjective, and (e) a plural pronoun and
a singular adjective and noun.
 (a) mòko tawàporenwokyry
 mòko ty- awàpo -ren wokyry
 that 3aml- happiness -Ama man
 ‘that happy man’
 (b) mòkarontawàporamon wokyryjan
 mòkaronty- awàpo -ramonwokyry -jan
 those3aml- happiness -Amaplman -plan
 ‘those happy men’
 (c) mòkarontawàporamon Karìna
 mòkaronty- awàpo -ramonKarìna
 those3aml- happiness -AmaplCarib
 ‘those happy Caribs’
of following it, seems to indicate that the two words aren’t juxtaposed nouns which might
occur in either order, but an adjective and a noun which have a fixed order. Compare amu
kawono wewe ‘a tall tree’, which is quite acceptable, whereas amu wewe kawono does not
occur. Word order in noun units, however, is not the same in all Cariban languages: in the
related Trio language, a word containing the -no morpheme may follow a noun as well as
precede it (Meira, p.c.).
(d) mòkaron pyimano179wokyryjan
mòkaron pyime -no wokyry -jan
those many -adn man -plan
‘those many men’
(e) mòkaron pyimano Karìna
mòkaron pyime -no Karìna
those many -adn Carib
‘those many Caribs’
 ral subject noun units may combine with a singular verb unit, when the noun unit
 ignates inanimate entities, e.g.:
tapita morokon pomyiman
ty- api -tamoro -kon pomyiman
3aml- red_colour -Viithat -pln pepper is
‘those peppers have become red’
morokon arakaposakynimorywanon
moro -kon arakaposaky- ni- morywa -non
that -pln riflealleg- aeo- make_noise -Tprau
‘those rifles make noise’
the case of a noun unit designating animate entities, a plural verb form is com-
 n:
Karìnamòkaronmanton
Karìnamòkaronman -ton
Carib thoseis -Tprapl
‘those people are Caribs’
 1Verb units
verb unit is a word unit interpreted to indicate a process including, in Carib as
ll as in many languages, a time relative to the moment of speaking. A Carib verb
 t consists of a single word: a finite verb form, so there is no need to discuss the
ucture of a verb unit. A finite verb may constitute a sentence. In two cases, how-
 r, a verb unit needs to be preceded by another word unit: (a) when the verb form
 refixless, and (b) when the verb form is a form of the verb (w)a ‘be’.
The use of a non-plural adjective form in noun units like examples (d) and (e) seems pretty
ch restricted to this single word pyimano, maybe because the concept of plurality is al-
dy present in the meaning of this word (‘many’). Many Caribs would gladly add the plural
fix -kon to pyimano in these and similar cases.
(a) A prefixless verb is preceded by an object noun unit. Only particle units whose
meaning is primarily associated with the object noun unit may occur between the
object noun unit and the verb unit. Other particle units follow the combination of
object noun unit and verb unit, if the object noun unit is sentence initial, or another
sentence initial word unit that precedes the object noun unit (see 2.24). Compare:
òmakon ajautytaseneja
a- myre -kon a- auty tasi- ene -ja
2- child -pln 2- house_of_...in1A- see -Tpr
‘I see your children in your house’
ajauty tasenejaòmakon
a- autytasi- ene -ja a- myre -kon
2- house_of_...in1A- see -Tpr 2- child -pln
‘in your house I see your children’
òmakon enejanajautyta
a- myre -kon ene -jana- auty ta
2- child -pln see -Tpru2- house_of_... in
‘he sees your children in your house’
òmakon roten enejan
a- myre -kon roten ene -jan
2- child -pln only see -Tpru
‘he sees only your children’
(b) Finite forms of the verb (w)a do not occur sentence initially. They are preceded
by at least an adjective unit or a noun unit. Compare these examples including an
adjective unit:
tonapire mana(mana tonapire does not occur)
ty- anapi -remana
3aml- lie -Amyou_are
‘you are deceitful’
tyka manton(manton tyka does not occur)
ty- (w)yka -je man -ton
3aml- say -Avhe_is -Tprapl
‘they are having said’ (i.e. ‘they have said’)
yjumy meman (man yjumy me does not occur)
y- jumy me man
1- father_of_... as he_is
‘he is (in the position of) my father’
case of an identification, two noun units indicating the entities that are identified
 h each other precede the finite form of the verb (w)a ‘be’, e.g.:
yjumymose man
y- jumymose man
1- father_of_...this (he)_is
‘this is my father’
yjumy amoro mana
y- jumyamoromana
1- father_of_...you (you)_are
‘you are my father’
ajenapirymoro man
a- anapi -ry moro man
2- lie -possc that (it)_is
‘that is your lie’ (i.e. ‘you are lying’)
wever, a single noun unit may precede forms of the verb (w)a, when people iden-
themselves or ask for an identification, using a noun unit consisting of a pro-
un, e.g.:
awu te wa
IbutI_am
‘(don’t be frightened;) it’s me’
nàna teman
we but(we)_are
‘(don’t be frightened;) it’s me and one or more others’
amoro teman?
you butare_you?
‘it’s you, isn’t it?’
2Adjective units
 adjective unit is a word unit interpreted to indicate a property. It modifies an
ity either directly, i.e. adnominally, or indirectly, i.e. adverbially. Direct modifi-
ion is indicated by an adnominal form of the adjective unit. Indirect modification
is shown by an adverbial form of the adjective unit. All and only classes of lexical
units that show a contrast between adverbial forms and adnominal forms may occur
as (part of) an adjective unit. Thus, an adjective unit may consist of one or more of
the following constituents:
(a) an adjective,
(b) a postposition preceded by a pronominal prefix, a noun or a noun unit,
(c) a numeral.
If an adjective unit modifies a noun unit that already includes a pronoun or numeral
and a noun (see 2.20), the adjective unit occurs in the middle. Examples with mòka-
ron paka ‘those cows’:
mòkaron takànamon paka
mòkaron ty- okàn -ramon paka
those 3aml- fast_run -Amapl cow
‘those fast running cows’
mòkaron Kumaka ponokon paka
mòkaron Kumaka po -no -konpaka
those Albina at -adn -pln cow
‘those cows in Kumaka (i.e. Albina)’
mòkaron okonokon paka
mòkaron oko -no -kon paka
those two -adn -pln cow
‘those two cows’
Examples of adverbial adjective units, with kynekànunjaton ‘they run’:
takàne kynekànunjaton
ty- okàn -re ky- ni- ekànumy -jaton
3aml- fast_run -Ama alleg- aeo- run -Tprpl
‘they run fast’
Kumakapo kynekànunjaton
Kumakapo ky- ni- ekànumy -jaton
Albinaat alleg- aeo- run -Tprpl
‘they run in Kumaka (i.e. Albina)’
oko kynekànunjaton
oko ky- ni- ekànumy -jaton
two alleg- aeo- run -Tprpl
‘they run two’ (i.e. ‘there are two running’)180
 3Interjection units
 interjection unit is a word unit interpreted to indicate an exclamation. An inter-
tion unit may consist of:
(a) an interjection,(b) a noun unit.
amples of interjections:
ykyjy!‘ouch!’uwa ‘no’
amples of interjection units consisting of a noun unit:
ijàwanympo pitani!
ijàwan -mpo pitani
badness -dev child
‘mischievous child!’
yjenery ìwa!
y- ene -ryi- `wa
1- see -possc 3- to
‘my seeing for him!’ (i.e. ‘he is looking at me!’)
 4Particle units
particle unit is a word unit interpreted to indicate a circumstance. In agreement
 h the fact that particles need the presence of a preceding word or word unit (see
12), in a sentence, particle units don’t occur without at least one word unit that
 cedes it. Typically, a particle is not interpreted to merge its meaning with just the
rd unit it follows. It typically provides a circumstance to the rest of the sentence
 to the speech situation, including even such matters as how the speaker feels
ut what is being said or how the speaker evaluates the truth of what is being said.
 he speaker does not want to associate the meaning of the particle unit primarily
 h another word unit, a particle unit will follow the sentence initial word unit.

Actually, only in combinations with transitive verbs, a word formed with the suffix -je is
 sidered a postpositionalization; a prefix or preceding noun phrase indicates the patient. In
 case of intransitive and middle verbs, there is no prefix or preceding noun phrase, and the
ulting formations with -je should be considered adjectivizations again. Compare: emamy
 e’ and amanje ‘in order to live’ (from emamy-je), (w)ai ‘be’ and aije ‘in order to be’ (from
ai-je). (Note the change of an initial e to a in the case of intransitive verb stems and the
ence of the stem initial (w) in the case of middle verbs.)
There may be a few exceptions of the suffix -ke combining with a noun that is more likely
e considered a mass noun, e.g. tykasirike ‘with cassava drink’, tytunake ‘with water’ (but
a ‘water’ may be considered a count noun as well, meaning ‘river’). However, a combina-
of the suffix -re with a count noun, seems to be impossible. A noun that normally is used
a count noun, needs to be interpreted as a mass noun in combination with the suffix -re.
mpare typanake ‘with ears’ and typanare ‘with (much) ear, hearing well’, tanuke ‘with
 s’ and tanure ‘with (much) eye, (very) able to see’, tysurapanke ‘with a horizontal rafter’,
tysurapane ‘having material for making a horizontal rafter’.
uwa‘dance’tuwake ‘(habitually) dancing’
uwake‘(habitually) dancing just like ...’
(w)ytopoty ‘walk’ tytopòke ‘(habitually) taking a walk’
wytopòke ‘(habitually) taking a walk just like ...’
-reThe suffix -re may be added to mass nouns. Following a diphthong end-
ing in i, -re changes to -je. Following a noun stem that ends in n, -re loses its r. Ex-
amples:
mynu‘blood’tymynure ‘bloody’
 mynure ‘having blood resembling ...’
ùwei‘fair hair’tùweije‘having fair hair’
 ùweije ‘having fair hair resembling ...’
posin ‘sweetness’typosine ‘sweet’
 posine ‘as sweet as ...’
-neThe suffix -ne is used (a) if the noun to which it is added shows its pos-
sessive form, and (b) in a number of exceptional cases.170 Examples:
auto‘house’
auty‘house’ (possessive form)
tautyne ‘having a house’
autyne‘having a house like ...’
yrapa ‘weapon’
yrapary ‘weapon’ (possessive form)
tyrapane‘armed’
yrapane ‘having a weapon like ...’
For some reason these two categories of words are associated with a final n. This is
clear from the fact that not only regarding the suffix -ne or -re, but also in other cas-
es where there are two variants of a morpheme, one following nouns ending in n
(e.g. -nto, -`ma) and the other following nouns that don’t end in n (-`to, -`pa), these
words combine with the variants that normally follow noun stems ending in n. Com-
pare with the words in the last examples:
170
The exceptions I know are: arepa ‘food’, àsaka ‘fellow tribesman’, atapy ‘side dish,
spread’, jopoto ‘leader’, omo ‘relative’, opi ‘medicin’, soropa ‘rib cage’, ynkàna ‘back’ and
yrapa ‘weapon’.
autynto‘provide with a house’ autỳma‘without a house’
yrapanto ‘provide with a weapon’irapàma ‘without a weapon’
ually, adjectivizing -ke or -re corresponds to adjectivizing -`pa, and -ne corre-
 nds to -`ma, but there are exceptions, e.g.::
tanarike ‘afraid’ but enarìma ‘not afraid’
tyjenonoke ‘full of hate’ but ijenonòma ‘not full of hate’
tykatanore ‘delicious’but ikatanòma ‘not delicious’
tỳketùke ‘with a strong taste’but ìketukùma ‘without a strong taste’
tỳsanore ‘cold’ but ìsanòma ‘not cold’
The suffix -je may be added to verb stems. Forms with adjectivizing -je
y be considered a static participle.171 The postpositionalizing -je indicates the
al of a movement. Both the adjectivizing and the postpositionalizing -je merge
o a verb stem final a, e, i (if not part of a diphthong), o or u. In the case of a verb
m final y, the suffix -je retains more of its original form. A verb stem final -py, -ty
-ky suffixed with -je merges into -`se. In the case of a stem final -my or -ry, and in
 case of a diphthong as well, the suffix -je retains its original form. Examples:
verb stemmeaningadjectivized postpositionalized
kupi ‘bathe’tykupikupi
ukuty‘know’ tukùseukùse
epory‘find’ topojeepoje
apoi ‘take’ tapoije apoije
the case of a transitive verb suffixed with postpositionalizing -je, a direct object
 st be expressed in the form of a prefix, or a preceding noun unit, unless the mid-
 prefix is present. In the case of intransitive verbs there is no prefix, and in the
 e of middle verb forms the middle stem without the stem initial w is used. Middle
 b stems combined with adjectivizing -je don’t lose the middle stem initial w.
ether adjectivizing or postpositionalizing -je merges into the stem final vowel or
 , the adjective plural morpheme -ine may be added, although in practice it seems
tricted to transitive verb forms without middle prefix. Examples:
Gildea 1994 218 describes this static participle as ‘an adjectival form of the verb, some-
 g like a participial’. In Hoff 1995a, it is called ‘a nonfinite verb form which has the syn-
 ic properties of an adjective’. I agree with both statements.
 kupi ‘bathe’tykupi ‘bathed’
 tykupine ‘bathed’ (plural)
 kupi ‘in order to bathe ...’
 kupine ‘in order to bathe ... (plural)’
 tywekupi ‘having bathed oneself’
 ekupi‘in order to bathe oneself’
 uwa‘dance’tuwa ‘having danced’
 uwa‘in order to dance’
 (w)ai ‘become’tywaije‘having become’
 aije ‘in order to become’
Combinations of monosyllabic transitive verb stems and postpositionalizing -je,
carry stress on a pronominal prefix, even if the plural suffix -ine is added. Compare:
 owo172 wòtake
 a- wo -jew- (w)opy -take
 2- kill -Pv1M- come -Tfut
 ‘I’ll come in order to kill you (singular)’
 owoinewòtake
 a- wo -je -inew- (w)opy -take
 2- kill -Pv -pla1M- come -Tfut
 ‘I’ll come in order to kill you (plural)’
When the object is indicated by a noun unit, the verb stem is preceded by an auxi-
liary stressed vowel y. Compare:
 mòko ywowòtake
 mòko wo -je w- (w)opy -take
 that_(person) kill -Pv1M- come -Tfut
 ‘I’ll come in order to kill him’
 mòkaron ywo wòtake
 mòkaron wo -jew- (w)opy -take
 those_(persons) kill -Pv1M- come -Tfut
 ‘I’ll come in order to kill them’
172
The initial o in owo is the stressed variant of a- ‘you’ (see 2.3).
nominal forms of postpositionalizing -je seem to be completely absent. Adnomi-
 forms of adjectivizing -je may occur, but seem to be restricted to intransitive
 bs, e.g.:
èmerepy ‘get crazy’ tòmerèse‘crazy’ (adverbial form)
tòmerèsen ‘crazy’ (adnominal form)
tòmerèsamon ‘crazy’ (adnominal form, plural)
kumyry‘be hungry’ tykumyje‘hungry’ (adverbial form)
tykumyjen ‘hungry’ (adnominal form)
tykumyjamon ‘hungry’ (adnominal form, plural)
tead of an adnominal form of a static participle a past infinitive combined with a
 fix i- that has lost its regular meaning is often more likely to be used. Such a past
initive is used similarly to an adnominal adjective, e.g.:
mòkaron èmerepỳsanworyijan
mòkaron i- èmerepy -`sanworyi -jan
those 3ml- turn_crazy -possucpl woman -plan
‘those women that have turned crazy’
mòkaronikumyrỳsan wokyryjan
mòkaron i- kumyry -`san wokyry -jan
those 3ml- turn_hungry -possucpl man -plan
‘those men that have turned hungry’
 tic participles are frequently combined with forms of the verb (w)a ‘be’. In the
 e of transitive verbs an agent of the verbal action may be expressed by means of
 postposition `wa ‘for, to’. Examples with man ‘he/she/it is’:
ekànumy ‘run’ takànunje man‘he has run’
(w)yka‘say’ tyka man ‘he has said’
etapuru ‘close’ tatapuje man ‘it is closed’
tatapuje ìwa man ‘it is closed by him’ or
 ‘he has closed it’
 adding the static participle of the verb (w)ai ‘become’, tywaije, to another static
 ticiple, attention is drawn to the beginning of the state indicated by the first static
 ticiple. Compare:
pyjaime man
medicine_man as he_is
‘he is (functioning as) a medicine man’
pyjaime tywaijeman
pyjaime ty- (w)ai -jeman
medicine_man as 3aml- become -Av he_is
‘he has become (functioning as) a medicine man’
tywo man
ty- wo -je man
3aml- kill -Av he_is
‘he has been killed’
tywo tywaije man
ty- wo -je ty- (w)ai -je man
3aml- kill -Av 3aml- become -Av he_is
‘he has (become a person who has) been killed’
To indicate that the state is something that belongs to the past, one may add the suf-
fix -mpo ‘devalued’ and the postposition me ‘as’ to the past participle. Compare:
tywompome man
ty- wo -je -mpome man
3aml- kill -Av -dev ashe_is
‘he has been killed in the past’
tywo tywaijempomeman
ty- wo -je ty- (w)ai -je -mpomeman
3aml- kill -Av 3aml- become -Av -dev ashe_is
‘he has (become a person who has) been killed in the past’
Forms with postpositionalizing -je may be expanded with the suffix -mpo ‘deva-
lued’. The combination designates a return from a movement toward a goal, e.g.:
moro poko aije
moro poko (w)ai -je
that about become -Pv
‘in order to become about that’ (i.e. ‘in order to get involved in that’)
moro poko aijempowopyi
moro poko (w)ai -je -mpo w- (w)opy -i
that about become -Pv -dev 1M- come -Tnr
‘I have returned from where I went getting involved in that’
 he suffix -mpo is used, the suffix -je is present again in the forms where it had
rged into a stem final vowel. The plural suffix -ine precedes the suffix -mpo.
mpare:
ypiryarojempowopyi
y- pi -ryaro -je -mpow- (w)opy -i
1- brother -possctransport -Pv -dev 1M- come -Tnr
‘I have returned from transporting my younger brother’
ajarojeinemponopyi
a- aro -je -ine -mpo ni- (w)opy -i
2- transport -Pv -pla -dev aeo- come -Tnr
‘he has returned from transporting you (plural)’
7.2 The suffixes -`pa, -tòme, -mene and -sene
e suffixes -`pa, -tòme, -mene and -sene have in common that they do not occur as
ectives combined with a prefix ty- (like the suffixes discussed in 2.17.1). Words
t include these suffixes occur in combination with other prefixes or are preceded
 a noun unit. These four suffixes will now be discussed in more detail.
a The suffix -`pa may adjectivize nouns and verbs. When it adjectivizes a
un, it combines with a prefix i- that has lost its regular third person meaning. The
mbination indicates an absence or non-possession of the entity designated by the
un. Combined with a noun stem ending in n (or with a possessive form of a noun,
some other exceptions; see 2.17.1), -`pa changes to -`ma. In adnominal forms
a and -`ma change to -pyn and -myn. For plural forms the regular adjective plural
fix -ine is used. In adnominal forms the nominal plural suffix -kon is added. The
mbination -pynkon or -mynkon may contract to -`non. Examples:
nounadverbial form adnominal form
singular pluralsingular plural
jeijèpaijèpaineijepyn ijepynkon / ijènon
‘tooth’
pun ipùmaipùmaineipumyn ipumynkon / ipùnon
‘flesh’
autoautỳma autỳmaine autymynautymynkon / autỳnon
‘house’
When the suffix -`pa is added to a verb stem, a prefix is obligatory, giving informa-
tion about the direct object. In the case of a transitive verb the following prefixes
may occur:
y-‘I’
a-‘you’
ky- ‘you and I’
ase-‘each other’
ani-‘transitive form’
i-‘passive form’
ase-/ai-/e-/os-/ot-/ò-‘middle form’
Intransitive verb stems combined with the suffix -`pa are prefixed with i-. Middle
verbs combined with the suffix -`pa simply lose the stem initial w. Examples:
kupi‘bathe’ ykupìpa‘not bathing me’
akupìpa‘not bathing you’
kykupìpa ‘not bathing you and me’
asekupìpa‘not bathing each other’
anikupìpa‘not bathing him’
ikupìpa‘not being bathed’
ekupìpa‘not bathing oneself’
kòta‘shout’ ikòtàpa‘not shouting’
(w)opy‘come’opỳpa‘not coming’
Plural and adnominal forms of a combination of a verb stem with -`pa are like those
of a combination of a noun stem and -`pa. Compare:
akupìpa ‘not bathing you’ (adverbial form)
akupìpaine‘not bathing you’ (adverbial form, plural)
akupipyn‘not bathing you’ (adnominal form)
akupipynkon / akupìnon‘not bathing you’ (adnominal form, plural)
Verb stems that normally reduce their final syllable (-py, -ty, -ky, -my or -ry) before
a suffix that does not have an initial plosive coda phoneme, do not show this reduc-
tion before -pyn. Compare: anukutỳpa ‘without knowing him’ (adverbial form) and
anukutypyn ‘without knowing him’ (adnominal form).

In the next sections, more examples will be given and specific issues concern-
ing the application and combination of cross-reference markers will be dis-
cussed in more detail.
5.1.1. Remarks on the cross-reference forms and further examples
With respect to table (22) above some remarks are in order. Firstly, most of the
object markers have to be combined with subject markers. Furthermore, some
object cross-reference forms are portmanteau morphemes. Finally, both third
person subjects and third person objects get zero morphological expression. In
the present section the constituent elements of cross-reference marking will be
discussed separately. First the subject forms will be dealt with, and then the
object forms, both in alphabetical order. Indefinite and impersonal argument
cross-reference will be dealt with in the separate sections (5.1.4.) and (5.1.5.)
respectively.

Kwaza," Remarks on word order
Being a morphologically complex language, with obligatory argument agree-
ment on the verb, Kwaza has a fairly simple syntax. Although it still remains to
be investigated thoroughly, word order appears to be quite free, and seems to
depend mainly on pragmatic factors. This will be briefly discussed in the pres-
ent section.
3.3.1. Introduction
The order of placement of the constituents in Kwaza clauses and phrases is
relatively free. In several footnotes throughout the present description, alterna-
tive word orders have been indicated by numbers. In such footnotes, word or-
der in the original sentence is implicitly symbolised as 1, 2, 3, etc., in numeri-
cal order from left to right. When an alternative word order of the same exam-
ple is attested, this is represented by a non-numerical order of these numbers,
1003. Parts of speech and constituent order
e.g. in notes such as “order 3-1-2 is also permitted” or “order 2-3-1 is ungram-
matical”. Notice the footnote that goes with the following example:
(28) Ǌmã'tİ-da-ki manini-tsu-'mãi 'ko-hͿ-tİ
 fish-1S-DEC fish-CL:bone-CL:tooth empty-NOM-NOM
 ‘I fished without a hook’83
The footnote indicates that the constituents of example (28) can occur in the
following alternative order:
(29) manini-tsu-'mãi'ko-hͿ-tİ Ǌmã'tİ-da-ki
 fish-CL:bone-CL:tooth empty-NOM-NOM fish-1S-DEC
 ‘I fished without a hook’
No goal-oriented research was done on word order in Kwaza. In most cases it
is not known what the exact semantic or pragmatic difference is between the
alternative word orders. In some cases it was observed that the first constituent
of a sentence receives focus. Of alternatives which were declared by my con-
sultant to be ungrammatical, or less felicitous than others, it has not been es-
tablished to what extent this is the case, and whether this really depends on
word order or on other factors.
3.3.2. Predicate and arguments
In intransitive sentences, subject-verb (SV) order is encountered more often
than verb-subject (VS) order, but upon explicit inquiry both are usually al-
lowed. Note the following sets of examples:
(30) 'xyi-dy-hͿ'kopu ko-'ro-tse
 you-POS-NOM cup without-CL:cup-DEC
 ‘your cup is empty’
(31) ko-'ro-tse 'xyi-dy-hͿ'kopu
 without-CL:cup-DEC you-POS-NOM cup
 ‘your cup is empty’
(32) e'tay xyi-dy-'hͿ-re (33) xyi-dy-'hͿ-re e'tay
 wife I-POS-NOM-INT I-POS-NOM-INT wife
 ‘is she your wife?’‘is she your wife?’
83. The order 2-3-1 is also permitted.
",1,No dominant order,"According to the descriptive grammar, the language described has no dominant word order.",No dominant order,0,0,
Kwaza,"1023. Parts of speech and constituent order
The constituents of this example can occur in the following alternative OVS
order, apparently without change of meaning:
(42) hita-'wã aure-da'mͿ-tse ho'Bİto
 Rita-AO marry-want-DEC Roberto
 ‘Roberto (says he) wants to marry Rita’
The order in (42) was considered as the “clearest” alternative, so this does indi-
cate that word order is not totally free. However, it does not necessarily mean
that SVO order is in general better than OVS. Notice the following example:
(43) kuraku'ra 'tsje-kijere'xwa
 chickenclose-DEC jaguar
 ‘jaguar grabbed chicken’
As mentioned in (4.1.1.6.), there may be a relation between the presumed op-
tionality of the animate case marker and word order. The nature of this relation,
however, has not been established so far. Note that on the application of an
animate case marker, VSO and SOV equivalents of (43) are also allowed:
(44) 'tsje-ki jere'xwa ku'rakura-'wã
 close-DEC jaguar chicken-AO
 ‘jaguar grabbed chicken’
(45) jere'xwa kuraku'ra-wã 'tsje-ki
 jaguar chicken-AO close-DEC
 ‘jaguar grabbed chicken’
The range of word order variability may not only depend partially on case
marking, but also on overt cross-reference agreement of subjects and the em-
phatic use of pronouns. Compare the following examples:
(46) si 'kui-da-ki hã (47) hã'kui-da-ki
 I drink-1S-DEC waterwater drink-1S-DEC
 ‘it is me who is drinking/drank water’‘I am drinking/drank water’
(48) *si hã 'kui-da-ki
 I water drink-1S-DEC
 ‘it is me who is drinking/drank water’
Example (48) was considered ungrammatical, but it is not clear how that
should be interpreted. In ditransitive sentences, the order relative position of
the direct and indirect objects is also variable:
3.3. Remarks on word order103
(49) mƭu marju-'wã 'hai-da-ki
 chicha Mario-AO drench-1S-DEC
 ‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’
(50) mƭu 'hai-da-ki marju-'wã
 chicha drench-1S-DEC Mario-AO
 ‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’
The following order is also permitted, although it is considered as less well-
formed:
(51) marju-'wã mƭu 'hai-da-ki
 Mario-AO chicha drench-1S-DEC
 ‘I gave Mario chicha to drink’
3.3.3. Predicate and satellites
The relative order of predicate and local satellites seems to be free. Compare
the next example to (34) :
(52) ã'rǊi waja-'nã-da-ki kreBa-'na
 tapir bring-FUT-1S-DEC Gleba-LOC
 ‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)
Notice also the following set of alternatives:
(53) ͅrjãwã-'na o'nİ-ki(54) o'nİ-ki ͅrjãwã-'na
 forest-LOC return-DEC return-DEC forest-LOC
 ‘he came/went out of the forest’‘he came/went out of the forest’
3.3.4. Predicate and adverbs
The relative order of predicate and adverbs is variable. The adverb occurs often
at the beginning or at the end of a clause:
(55) la'to tsu'ty kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki
 yesterday head hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC
 ‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’
(56) la'to kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki tsu'ty
 yesterday hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEChead
 ‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’
1043. Parts of speech and constituent order
(57) kukui-'dy-da-ky-hͿ-ki tsu'ty la'to
 hurt-CAU-1S-PAST-NOM-DEC head yesterday
 ‘I had a pain in the head yesterday’
The adverb does not necessarily occur at the periphery of the clause:
(58) a-ri'tsaa'wͿi-da-ki coha-si'ki
 Ø-DR:outside see-1S-DEC foot-CL:skin
 ‘I saw a shoe outside’ (S outside (looking in))
(59) a'wͿi-da-ki a-ri'tsa coha-si'ki
 see-1S-DEC Ø-DR:outside foot-CL:skin
 ‘I saw a shoe outside’ (S outside (looking in))
3.3.5. Noun and modifier
The usual constituent order of modification constructions is head-dependent:
(60) txa'hͿ tsi'cwa-rjͿ 'Ǌi-da-ki
 path begin-CD:area lie-1S-DEC
 ‘I rested at the beginning of the road’
However, an alternative order is also attested. Compare these examples:
(61) 'tauBa a'xy-dy-a-'hͿ(62) a'xy-dy-a-'hͿ'tauBa
 boardhouse-CAU-1P-NOMhouse-CAU-1P-NOM board
 ‘boards to build a house’‘boards to build a house’
The following set of examples shows how the relative order between a noun
and a demonstrative modifier order may vary, and even how a matrix predicate
may be inserted between an argument and the demonstrative:
(63) ko'sa Ϳ-'hͿ si-dy-'hͿ-ki(64) Ϳ-'hͿko'sa si-dy-'hͿ-ki
 sun this-NOM I-POS-NOM-DEC this-NOM sun I-POS-NOM-DEC
 ‘the / this lantern is mine’ ‘the / this lantern is mine’
(65) ko'sa 'si-dy-hͿ-ki Ϳ-'hͿ
 sun I-POS-NOM-DEC this-NOM
 ‘the / this lantern is mine’
However, it may be possible that the demonstrative in (65) stands in extraposi-
tion.
",1,No dominant order,"The language described in the grammar does not have a dominant word order. The constituents can occur in different orders without a change in meaning. However, the order in (42) (OVS) was considered as the ""clearest"" alternative. The word order may depend on case marking, cross-reference agreement, and the emphatic use of pronouns. The relative order of predicate and local satellites, predicate and adverbs, and noun and modifier seems to be free.",No dominant order,0,0,
Kwaza,"3.3. Remarks on word order101
In transitive sentences, object-verb (OV) order is encountered more often than
verb-object (VO) order, but upon explicit inquiry both are usually allowed.
Note the next pairs of examples:
(34) kreBa-'na ã'rǊi waja-'nã-da-ki
 Gleba-LOC tapir bring-FUT-1S-DEC
 ‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)
(35) kreBa-'na waja-'nã-da-kiã'rǊi
 Gleba-LOC bring-FUT-1S-DEC tapir
 ‘I’m going to take the horse to Gleba’ (riding it or not)
(36) tsİ̘hedy-'ra(37) hedy-'ra tsİ̘
 salt mix-IMPmix-IMP salt
 ‘put salt (on the food/drink)!’ ‘put salt (on the food/drink)!’
In transitive sentences with an overt subject and an overt object, the order is
usually SVO or SOV. No difference in meaning has been discovered between
these different orders:
(38) kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki zjwãu(39) kanwã=ekai-'e zjwãu o'tsi-ki
 canoe=leg-too kill-DEC João canoe=leg-too João kill-DEC
 ‘the car killed João’84 ‘the car killed João’
About an OSV equivalent of the above examples, my consultant remarked that
this would be nonsense:
(40) *?zjwãu kanwã=ekai-'e o'tsi-ki
 João canoe=leg-too kill-DEC
 ‘João killed the car’
Apparently then, in a construction where subject and object precede the predi-
cate, the first position is likely to be reserved for the subject.85
Other word orders have also been attested. Notice the following SVO ex-
ample:
(41) ho'Bİto aure-da'mͿ-tse hita-'wã
 Roberto marry-want-DEC Rita-AO
 ‘Roberto (says he) wants to marry Rita’
84. Animate object marking was not considered as very grammatical: *zjwãwã.
85. If ‘car’ would be marked as an animate object: kanwã?ekai'?ewã, the OSV order
 would be acceptable, according to my teacher, but the meaning of the sentence
 would be nonsense.

In addition, when one animate noun ""belongs"" to another- i.e., to 'him', 'her,' or wasis·ok ksinuhk·iyik 'the children (proximate) are sick'

same grammatical space. (In the examples below, the second form of the obviative
plural is more frequently used by Maliseet speakers.)This particular obviative agreement is not obligatory for all speakers; some might
 say, for example, Piyel witapiyil ksinuhka, in which the verb has a proximate ending.

This distinction on the verb between subject and object focus questions is related
 to the word order of interrogative questions and the structural properties of verb phrases
 in Mekens. We saw in section 3.3 above that the object NP forms a constituent with the
 transitive verb, but that the subject NP does not. Therefore, questioning the object in
 sentence initial position violates the adjacency and linear order constraints of verb
 phrase constituents (cf. section 3.3.), whereas questioning the subject does not.

Mekens," On the other hand the use of the focus particle ‘re’ following the question word
is more frequent in object focus questions. In fact, it is hard to find examples of object
focus questions without the focus particle. This distribution is a direct result of the word
order pattern in Mekens, in the same way that the verb form distinction between subject
and object focus questions is. We have seen in previous sections of this work that the
unmarked word order in simple sentences is SOV. In subject focus questions, the
interrogative word occurs in the same position that the subject occurs in a declarative
sentence. On the other hand, object focus questions will necessarily have a constituent
order different from a corresponding declarative sentence: OSV vs. SOV. Thus, the use
of a formal focus marker would be pragmatically and structurally more expected in
object than in subject focus questions, while the emphatic particle would be expected to

Mekens," The core arguments (S, A, O) of a verb in Mekens are not overtly marked for
case; nonetheless, they are readily identifiable in a clause by the word ordering and
adjacency constraints discussed in section 3.3 above. The basic word order in a simple
transitive clause is subject-object-verb (SOV). Changing the order of the NPs reverses
the grammatical relations, as seen in (98a-b).

 The object argument of a transitive verb is syntactically defined as the NP
immediately preceding the verb if the object is nominal or the agreement prefix on the
verb, if it is pronominal. While, given the right context, the subject of a clause may
occur in different positions without any change in the form of the verb, the object may
not (cf. section 3.3).

Mekens," Although it is not always easy to distinguish between a complex word and a
phrase, some properties are specific of complex words. Complex words have
idiosyncratic meaning, that is, the lexical meaning of a complex word can not always be
derived from the meaning of its parts, as in (lOOa-c). Also the order of constituents
inside a complex word may be different from the regular order inside a phrase. The
complex noun in (lOOd) is formed by an Adjective followed by a Noun, while in a noun
 phrase the adjective always follows the noun it modifies. Contrary to (lOOd), the

Further evidence that the object NP forms a constituent with the transitive verb
is found in clauses where it does not occur in its usual position, preceding the verb. The
basic order o f constituents in Mekens sentences is S(ubject), 0(bject), and V(erb), as
 presented in Galucio (1996b). Hence, when the object does not immediately precede
 the verb, a prefix occurs to the left of the verb stem occupying the object position (for
 an analysis of this prefix as a formal object marker, and not a regular person prefix see
 sections 3.3.3 and 4.4 below). This structural description is met in question-word
 questions asking about the object, cleft clauses, and other type of clauses that place the
 focus on the object. Examples are given in (11). In (11a) the constituents occur in their
 unmarked SOV order, and there is no marking on the verb. (1 lb), on the other hand, is a
 question-word question that focuses on the object. Hence, the object does not appear in
 front of the verb, and the object marker prefix fills in that position. Similarly, in (11c)
the unmarked order is found, whereas in (1 Id), a cleft type clause, the object is focused
at the beginning of the clause, and the object marker prefix occurs on the verb.

Menya,"The vast majority of clauses in any natural language contain, as their structural and semantic core, a
verb which connects most if not all the other elements into a meaningful whole. The objective in this
section is to provide an overview of the structure of the verbal clause in Menya. Many of the specific
details provided in this section are drawn from a careful analysis of 8 mixed-genre texts authored by three
different speakers and containing a total of 758 clauses, of which 725 are verbal.
2.3.1 Word order
Menya is quite rigidly a verb-final language. As is the norm for Papuan languages of the proposed
Trans-New Guinea Phylum, the basic clause order is SOV regardless of whether S and O are expressed as
noun phrases or pronouns. Table 4 displays the distribution of the possible word orders (row labels)
according to NP manifestation options (column labels) as found in the 758 clause sample16. In the column
labels, order is not significant but upper case represents NP manifestation and lower case represents
pronominal expression. In elicited data, the SOV order is invariant; in text data it is overwhelmingly more
frequent. In the majority of clauses in natural text (663 in this sample), there is not an overt reference to
both S and O, other than by verbal affixation, and so three-term basic word order is not fully applicable.
Where only one of S and O is overt, however, it is almost invariably before the verb, confirming the verb-
final pattern.

 function definitionlabel
 psychological subject‘that which is the concern of the message...theme
what the speaker had in mind to start with...’
 grammatical subject‘that of which something is predicated... seensubject
to determine various other grammatical features...’
 logical subject‘doer of the action... having to do with relationsactor
between things...’
In the default or basic encoding of a proposition in Menya, the three subjects converge on a single
entity, as is the case for English. English has a very clear category of grammatical subject and employs
constructions such as the passive to make changes in its assignment, with concomitant changes to other
grammatical features such as verb agreement and pronoun selection. Menya, on the other hand, does not
exhibit such flexibility. Grammatical subject status is assigned by the case frame17 of the verb (4.1.2) and
its only grammatical correlate is that it is not case-marked (2.3.3 and 3.1.2). Though verb agreement is
extensive in Menya (2.3.3 and 4.2), it is determined by the logical relations ACTOR and AFFECTEE -- the
most salient entity, other than the actor, who is affected by the event. Word order is determined by
pragmatic factors, including assignment of the psychological subject function. Most verbs assign
grammatical subject status to the actor and its referent is more often than not the speaker’s choice as the
psychological subject, leading to the frequent convergence of the three subject functions. The minimal role
for syntax in the clause that is described here is not unusual for Papuan languages. Foley (1986:175) states
that “for Barai, syntax must be recognized as an independent parameter in the organization of the clause.
This is the only Papuan language I know for which this holds, whereas it is the norm for European
languages.”
The dominant syntactic function that has been described as subject-oriented for Papuan languages is
the switch-reference system – the marking of one clause to indicate whether the tracked referent is the same
or different in the subsequent text. It is generally described as same subject (SS) and different subject (DS)
marking but there is disagreement as to which subject function is being tracked18. For Menya (5.1.2), the
17
 Fillmore introduced the concept of case frame in his 1968 article. The case frame of a verb specifies what nominal
 arguments need to be identified to fully specify the predication.
18
 In Foley’s (1986:183ff.) analysis it is the Actor that is being tracked so he uses the terms same-actor and different-
22
overriding factor in the switch-reference system is pragmatic, the topical entity being tracked. In the
unmarked or normal scenario, especially in main-line material, the topical entity of a larger stretch of
discourse is also the psychological subject of each clause19. Since most verbs assign the subject function to
the actor and this referent is the default choice as psychological subject, the crucial examples for
determining what function is actually being monitored are a minority of the marked clauses.

2.3.2 The status of subject and object
 The discussion thus far assumes that S and O are clearly defined and readily identifiable elements,
generally labelled ‘subject’ and ‘object’. That is, however, a false assumption as witnessed by the extensive
literature in the past 30 years (for example, Li 1976 and Schachter 1977) about the definition and status of
subject. Halliday (1994:30-33) points out that three distinct functions have been labelled as ‘subject’ and
that in many clauses the three converge on a single referent, leaving no ambiguity. In other clauses,
however, these functions are spread between two different referents, with any one of the three functions
able to have a distinct referent than that of the other two. In still other instances, the functions can be
assigned to different referents without any overlap. His three functions, their definition, and his preferred
labels are summarized in Table 5.

4.3 Verbal modification
This section will present various aspects of verbal modification that can occur within what I am calling
the verbal phrase95 – a group of words occurring and acting together to specify the nature of the predicated
situation apart from the NP arguments that identify the participants and props of whom the situation is
predicated. In keeping with the verb-final nature of Menya, but in contrast to the position of modifiers in
the noun phrase (3.3.2), the modifiers to be presented here all precede their head. Modification is in the

In his discussion of the term ‘verb phrase,’ Crystal (1997:41) contrasts the traditional use, defined as “a group of
 verbs which together have the same syntactic function as a single verb, e.g. is coming, may be coming, get up to”
 with the more recent generative use that includes the NPs other than the subject. My ‘verbal phrase’ is between the
 two in terms of what it includes.

2.6.1. General features. Word order
The Ayoreo syntax is relatively simple. Unlike several native American languages,
Ayoreo does not exhibit ‘switch reference’. The default word-order is SVO, although it
may be altered for pragmatic reasons. In genitival constructions, the order is determinant +
determined (or modifier + head). Thus, Ayoreo is in this respect like English: namely, it
exhibits symptoms of diachronic change, for the basic word-order and the determinant +
determined order do not converge.

includes a noun and a postposition. Most postpositional phrases express the Location constituent,
but postpositional phrases also express the marginal clause constituents Instrument and
Association. The order in which the marginal constituents occur within a clause varies with style
and emphasis; they tend to occur before the subject. It is unusual to have more than two marginal

chapter 27
Sentence word order
As has been mentioned above, the neutral word order in Nivkh sentences is “sub-
ject (often omitted) – direct object – predicate”, “attribute – head word”. Conjunctive
words, if used, usually precede the subject (see 18.2.2). Adverbials of time and place
also, it seems, precede the subject in most cases. Adverbials of manner are usually
post-posed to the subject. As a rule, converbs which may perform a variety of syntactic
functions precede the finite predicate (see 14.5).
",1,SOV,"Based on the paragraph, the neutral word order in Nivkh sentences is ""subject (often omitted) - direct object - predicate"", ""attribute - head word"". Therefore, the dominant word order in the language is ""No dominant order"".",No dominant order,1,0,

                         ‘He stuck the paper to the wall.’
In sentences with these verbs the nominative object (a movable object) often pre-
cedes the object in the dative/additive case (a stationary object), if this is required by
the communicative purpose of the utterance. This word order is often perceived as
neutral; cf.:

Nivkh," There are no adjectives in Nivkh. Meanings like ‘be strong’ , ‘be gray’ are expressed
by qualitative verbs. Possessive meanings, as in ‘father’s knife’ , ‘our house’ , are expressed
by pre-posed nouns (personal pronouns) in the nominative case, in the attributive
position (see (1b), (1d)).
1.2 Syntax
The neutral word order is “subject (often omitted) – direct object – predicate”; “attri-
bute – head word”. A typical Nivkh sentence contains one finite predicate which may
be preceded by one or several (rarely more than five) converbs. The sequence of verbal
forms iconically reflects, as a rule, the chronological sequence of the events, which
they denote, in reality.

Further on, we shall discuss neutral word order and marked word order. The latter, with
the exception of specially defined cases, is not related to emphasis or contrastive stress.
Emphasis is usually expressed prosodically by intonation and special grammatical
devices: long or open vowels, special particles. Focusing may be indicated by the par-
ticle -ra/-ta/-da. Thus, in (405) with neutral word order any sentence constituent may
be in focus if it is placed sentence-initially and marked with the particle -ra/-ta/-da:
 (405) Nəmr ŋaŋəŋñivγ-gu pal-uxq‘otr+ñřə-d̦.
                 yesterday hunter-pl forest-loc/abl bear+see-ind
                 ‘Yesterday the hunters saw a bear in the forest.’
The following words may be placed sentence-initially: Nəmr-ta ‘just yesterday (not
the day before yesterday)’ (as in ‘It was yesterday that …’), pal-ux-ta ‘in the forest (not
on the river bank)’ (as in ‘It was in the forest that …’), q‘otr-ta ‘a bear (not a wolf)’ ,
ŋaŋəŋñivγ-gu-da ‘the hunters (not the women).’
 Focusing by means of the particle -ra/-ta/-da is not necessarily combined with

Cupeño," Jelinek (1997) considers reduplication a form of adverbial quantification. That
is, the quantification is over the entire sentence, implicating agents and patients.
If this proposal is correct, it may explain why consultants offered such diverse
interpretations for reduplicated forms. The principal constraint on the scope of
adverbial quantification is probably pragmatic implicature. The differences be-
tween “distribution”—imagining several individuals or actions, each occurring in
one place—versus “repetition”—a single individual doing the same thing several
times in succession, in the same place—versus “duration”—imagining a continu-
ous state or ongoing performance—involve subtle judgments. It is difficult to study
this sort of quantification even in fully vigorous linguistic communities. However,
there is no reason to believe that Cupeño reduplication is very different from that

reported elsewhere, and a speaker trying to develop new forms of expression in the
language could safely draw on reduplication to create a variety of subtle aspectual
effects while remaining within the “spirit” of the grammar of the language as
attested among its last speakers.

 Complex nominal constructions are sometimes “continuous,” with all of the
elements appearing adjacent to one another. However, such constructions often
exhibit discontinuity, being interrupted by other components of the sentence. Such
discontinuous constituents are very common in Cupeño, appearing in both the
Faye corpus and in my own data. They are completely acceptable to speakers. Not
only are they produced both in response to elicitation and in extemporaneous text
recitation, but they survived unchanged when my principal consultant, Roscinda
Nolasquez, corrected taped text recitations (examples are seen in (28) and (66)
below). I have discussed the theoretical implications of Cupeño discontinuous
constituents in Hill (2003). Here I restrict the discussion primarily to the descrip-
tion of the surface properties of complex nominal constructions in Cupeño, show-
ing their behavior in “continuous” constructions and in “discontinuous” construc-
tions.

4 Grammar - The Verb Phrase
4.1 The infinitive
The infinitive is formed with verb stem followed by the suffix -mak/-mek:
almak (to buy/take)gelmek (to come)
almazlyk (not to buy)gelmezlik (not to come)
The verb stem is the second person singular form of the imperative (see “Imperative Mood”).
The infinitive, however, declines as follows:
NOMalmak (to buy/take)
ACCalmagy
GENalmagyň
DATalmaga (in order to buy/take)
LOC/TIMalmagda
ABLalmagdan
Apart from the nominative and dative cases it is almost impossible to translate these without a context, as
English simply doesn't have anything remotely like this. The following examples will help a little:
Un almak kyn boldy - it was difficult to get flour
[U:n almak ky:n boldy]
Un almagyň kyndygyny sen bileňokmy? - don't you know how hard it is to buy flour?
Men un almaga geldim - I came (in order) to buy flour [purpose: to by flour]
Şu gün un almagy ýatdan çykarma - don't forget to buy flour today!
Un almakda kynçylyk bar - [in general] it is difficult to buy flour
Un almakdan başga işler hem bar - (I've) got better things to do than buying flour!
The infinitive acts in the same way as an English participle: the last example would be “flour buying-(apart)
from other work also exists”.
The infinitive can also be possessed as follows:
my studying etc.spl
1 meniň okamagym biziň okamagymyz
2 seniň okamagyň siziň okamagyňyz
3 onuň okamagy olaryň okamaklary
(notice the k in the 3rd person plural)
It seems that whereas in the English language participles can be possessed, in Turkmen only infinitives can,
so again the gloss of a Turkmen infinitive is an English participle.
Kartoçka (boýunça) berilýänzatlary şu günseniň almagyň gerek
ration-card(by)being-given thingsthis dayyourbuyingis-necessary
you need to buy the food we get on ration cards today
 Seniň okamazlygyň saňa zyýan etdi, sen ekzamenden ikilik aldyň
 - your lack of study was your downfall, you got two [out of five] in the exam
 Uniwersitetde studentleriň okamaklary üçin şertler döredildi
 - The University created conditions under which students could study

David Gray A Short Descriptive Grammar of Turkmen16/12/2011
1 Introduction
Turkmen is a Turkic language, part of the South-Western or Oguz sub-group which includes Turkish,
Azerbaijani, and Gagauz. It is an agglutinative language i.e. it has a highly developed system of noun and
verb suffixes that can produce some very long words indeed, e.g. from the word okuw which means ‘study’
the following word/sentence can be derived:
 Okuwçylaryňkymyka? – I wonder if it belongs to the school children?
There are over six million speakers of Turkmen world-wide, most of them located in Turkmenistan, Iran, and
Afghanistan. Turkmen society is still fairly tribal, so that the Turkmen language is made up of several
dialects. The literary language dates back to the 18th century, with poets such as Magtymguly writing highly
stylised works including many Persian (Farsi) loan-words. Modern literary Turkmen is mainly based on the
Teke and Yomut dialects spoken in and around Ashgabat, Mary, Dash Oguz (formally Dashhowuz) and
Nebitdag. Although Turkmen residents of the larger cities tend to be strongly bilingual in Turkmen and
Russian, any attempts to Russify the literary language have been resisted, although many technical words are
Russian or have come via Russian. Dialects spoken in Iran tend to be influenced by Farsi and those in
Afghanistan Dari and Uzbek. This grammar concentrates on Turkmen as spoken in Turkmenistan.

Gerunds can be used with the accusative case to convey that one action was performed in order
to complete another, separate action (see p.689). To express similar statements that lack
directional action (sentences with verbs that do not take the dative case), the construction is

duration (sagad-a ‘for an hour’), goal, direction (gapy-na ‘towards the door’), or purpose
(gör-mä:g-e ‘(in order) to see’ < see-INF-DAT). Verbs requiring use of the dative case tend to
convey inherent or implied directionality (e.g., garamak ‘inspect, look at’). Allomorph -nA

(onuň köpüsi ‘most of it’ < 3SG.GEN much-3.POSS) and numerals (biz-iň bä:şimiz ‘the five of
us’ < 1PL-GEN 5-3PL.POSS), which appear after the pronoun. All of these elements, including
the head noun, are optional, since noun phrases may be headless, consisting of only, e.g.,
an adjective (gyzyl-lar ‘the red ones’ < red-PL), in which case they imply an indefinite
referent. Postpositional phrases may not stand on their own as headless noun phrases
(*meniň bilenler ‘those with me’, but rather men-iň ýan-ym-da:ky adam-lar ‘those people
who are with me’ < 1SG-GEN side-1SG.POSS-AFIL man-PL), and genitives must take the relation

The “canonical” order in Turkmen is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). That is, syntactic subjects
(S), patients (P), and recipients (R) all tend to precede the verb. These preferences result
in the following orders: SV for intransitives, SPV for transitives, and SRPV for ditransitives.
Core arguments, however, are often not given overtly when relatively unimportant for the
present or imminent discourse, or if they are easily recoverable or discourse-active.

Kham,"302 14 Non-declarative speech acts
 Lyons (1977:755) observes that it is not essential to the nature of questions to always
require an answer. That they normally obtain an answer, he says, is due to conventional
expectations. He goes on to make a distinction between ‘asking’ a question and ‘posing’
a question. Asking is more complex in that it includes an indication that the posed
question requires a response, and also necessarily assumes that the addressee knows the
answer. The distinction works well for Kham. The difference between direct and
indirect questions is essentially the same as the one between Lyon’s ‘asked’ and ‘posed’
questions – a difference that rests on the requirement of an answer.
14.1.1 Direct questions
Direct questions imply that the speaker has some kind of personal investment in the
situation being questioned, and, as a result, has a right to the information. The direct
question makes its demand by virtue of the interlocutor’s relationship to the action, or
by his/her position of authority to ask such a question. Used incorrectly the question
sounds rude and presumptuous.2
 i. Direct content questions (see §9.3)
Content questions provide us with a good example of the speaker involvement implicit
in direct questions. It is not the question word itself that makes for a direct question, but
the paradigmatic form of the verb. (Content questions occur also in indirect form, as we
shall later see.) Consider the following:
(1)kana n˙-ba-zya
 where 2S-go-CONT (DIRECT)‘Where are you going?’
(2)kata j˙i-wa
 what make-3S :PFV (DIRECT) ‘What did s/he make?’
Both questions imply more than idle curiosity. A possible context for (1), for example,
might be that a mother has given orders to her son to go fetch firewood, and now when
she sees him, his actions seem counter to what was ordered. The question, then, asks
the son to give an account of his actions. Utterance (2) implies that the speaker wants
specific details; details like ‘Name the object! (I had a contract for such and such).’ The
same questions in indirect form do not have the same force (see the contrastive examples
in 8 and 9).

Kham," Also part of verbal morphology are fairly elaborate derivations related to transitivity
and voice – those of causativization and detransitivization.
ii. Case marking alignment
The general alignment of grammatical case markers in Kham is ‘split ergative,’ based
on a person split in which first (1ST ) and second (2ND) person rank high on a nominal
hierarchy, and third (3RD) person ranks low. The case marking split has radical reper-
cussions in verb morphology as well. Object marking is tied, ultimately, to pragmatic
 1.1 Language typology3
notions of identifiability.
1.1.3 Constituent order
Kham has a basic constituent order of AOV, SV in both main and dependent clauses.
The attendant ‘harmonic orders’ in phrase level syntax also occur: DemN, NumN, GN,
AN, and RelN (where for Kham, A is a type of RelCl). A non-restrictive order for
modification in NPs, a kind of appositive, also occurs in which the order of all constituents
but DemN and GN are reversed to NNum, NA, and NRel.
1.1.4 Grammatical roles
Unlike what is reported for some TB languages, the grammatical roles ‘subject’ and
‘object’ are well motivated in Kham. In unmarked declarative clauses, S and A (usually
agents, but not always) are grouped together and form the pivot for syntactic operations
like clause chaining and subordination.
",1,SOV,"The language described in the given paragraph has a dominant word order of AOV, SV in both main and dependent clauses. Therefore, the answer is ""AOV, SV"".

I apologize for the mistake. The language described in the given paragraph has a dominant word order of AOV, SV in both main and dependent clauses. Therefore, the answer is ""No dominant order"".",No dominant order,1,0,
Kham," Because we are dealing with verbs and their arguments, not just verbal morphology,
we will be dealing necessarily with simple clauses. As such, I will establish a basic
constituent order for Kham and show how other syntactic notions are linked to this
constituent order. We will examine also, among other things, the propositional semantics
of all the basic verb types and determine how the propositions are affected by valence
increasing and decreasing voice operations like the causative and passive.
11.1Basic constituent order in simple clauses
Kham, like all other languages of the area, both Tibeto-Burman and Indo-Aryan, is an
AOV, SV language. Most implicational universals (Greenberg 1966) tied to this constituent
order are valid for Kham. Where they appear to be contradictory, historical explanations
are usually evident. AOV languages, for example, have been shown to be overwhelmingly
suffixing. As we have seen already, however, Kham verbs are just as much prefixing as
they are suffixing – 1ST and 2ND person subject agreement markers, for example, are
prefixed to the verb in modern Takale. A proper understanding of historical developments
shows that the modern prefixing patterns come from an old nominalization. The subject
prefixes are erstwhile possessive markers, in which case Kham is a well behaved AOV
 1
Transitivity, as I use the term here, is not equivalent to Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) notion of a
 ‘transitivity hierarchy’ in which there is a ranking not only of event types, but also of agent and
 modality types – some being more prototypically transitive than others. Rather, transitivity is an
 inherent property of the verb specifying the number of obligatory arguments associated with the verb
 (and, as such, is more akin to Payne’s notion (1985) of ‘inherent transitivity’).
",1,SOV,"The language described in the grammar is an ""AOV, SV language"". Therefore, its dominant word order is ""AOV"".
Choose one of the four options: ""SVO"", ""SOV"", ""No dominant order"", and ""Not enough information"".
Sorry for the mistake. The dominant word order of the language is ""AOV"", so the answer is ""No dominant order"".",No dominant order,0,0,
Kham," In a performative account of imperatives it is argued that an imperative like ‘Leave!’
is an abbreviated form of ‘I order you to leave’ < ‘I order you + you will leave.’ Thus,
the ‘you’ which is implied in the imperative is, in fact, an object of the higher performative
predicate ‘I order you.’ Kham apparently grammaticalizes the implied subordination by
casting the subject of the direct imperative (the verbal affix) in the form of an object. In
the indirect imperative, any implications of subordination (and hence, speaker control)
are purposely severed by casting the agent of the imperative as a syntactic subject. As
Searle observes, by being indirect ‘compliance can be made to appear a free act rather
than obeying a command’ (1979:48). This is apparently the difference between the
direct and indirect imperatives in Kham.
14.2.2 Direct imperatives
The imperative in Kham is marked for the person and number of both subjects and
objects. In table 79 are excerpts for the direct imperative paradigm. (The more complete
paradigm is given in §5.2.2, table 24.) In the intransitive paradigm the singular subject
referent is marked by -ni (which is also the 2ND singular object marker in transitive
declaratives), while in the transitive paradigm singular subject is unmarked (Ø).

Kham," • Using an adverbial word. The first process involves the addition of an adverbial
word to the ‘send’ construction. Though the resulting construction implies stronger
force than the simple ‘send’ construction, the result is still non-implicative:
(42) kacabul da-op˙r~î:-ke-r˙
obligingly do-COMP send-PFV -3S
‘They obliged/strongly urged him to do it.’
 • Using an adverbial clause chain. The second process involves the addition of an
adverbial clause chain, again a non-implicative meaning based on ‘send’:
(43) g˙hl˙i-d˙ da-o p˙r~î:-ke-o
urge-NF do-COMP send-PFV -3S
‘He urged him to do it.’ (lit. ‘urging him, sent him to do it’)
 • Using separate lexical items. Other manipulative verbs of causation in Kham are
loan words from Nepali, one meaning ‘to force’ (or more exactly ‘to exert force’ – much
like kacabul in 42) and the other ‘to order.’ Both require a different kind of complement
structure, and will be taken up again in a later section.
 iii. Verbs of permission and agreement
Verbs of permission and agreement follow the same syntactic structure that we have
seen for verbs of causation. Verbs of permission are primarily manipulative verbs – the
manipulator is the subject of the main clause and the manipulee (here a ‘permitee’) is its
object. The verbs of agreement, on the other hand, are modal verbs with equi-subject
restrictions.

8 Argument structure and syntax of the clause
This chapter deals with the argument structure of the verb and with constituent order in
the clause. Unmarked word order in Mian is SOV. While the verb is almost always final
in any clause (two marginal exceptions will be dealt with below), the order of
arguments and adverbial adjuncts is less rigidly fixed.
",1,SOV,"The language described in the grammar has a dominant word order of ""SOV"" (Subject-Object-Verb).",SOV,0,0,
Mian," If the argument positions of a verb are filled by full NPs instead of pronouns, the
unmarked constituent order is also SOV. Overt subject NPs usually precede direct
object NPs. This order is very consistent in elicited examples.
(8-58) nakae unangó watemebe
 naka=eunǎng=owa-tem-Ø-e=be
 man=SG.M woman=SG.F 3SG.F.O-see.PFV-PST-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
 ‘The man has seen the woman’
In natural discourse, however, relative order of subject and direct object is less
consistently SOV. This usually does not create problems due to the language’s head-
marking characteristics, which in most cases allow the identification of syntactic
relations through information from the pronominal affixes without having to take word
order information into account. Deviation from the unmarked order in natural discourse
will be discussed in 8.2.2.
",1,SOV,The language described in the grammar has a dominant SOV word order.,SOV,0,0,
Mian," Unmarked word order is Subject-Object-Verb. Due to the head-marking
characteristics of the language, constituent order is relatively free with the restriction
that the verb is clause-final.
",1,SOV,"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, the dominant word order of the language is ""SOV"" (Subject-Object-Verb).",SOV,0,0,
Mian,"Unmarked word order in medial and final clauses and independent sentences is SOV.
Due to the head-marking characteristics of the language, constituent order is relatively
free with the restriction that the verb is clause-final. The verb is only followed by an
illocutionary clitic which marks sentences as declarative, exclamative, interrogative,
quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials are possible but rare. Under no
circumstances can the verb be followed by an overt NP argument.
",1,SOV,The dominant word order of the language described in the grammar is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).,SOV,0,0,
Mian,"Although there is no knockdown evidence for embedding in head-internal relative
clauses, there are some examples which prima facie conflict with this claim. If the
relativized item functions as the direct object in the relative clause and the subject is
overtly realized as a pronoun, the only attested word order is:
(11-69) nakae né atemie
naka=e né a-tem-Ø-i=e
man=SG.M I 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-PST-1SG.SBJ=SG.M
‘the man whom I’ve seen’
 467
This case provides problematic evidence because the constituent order OSV in (11-69)
is not possible in independent sentences if the subject is a free (non-emphatic) pronoun.
Compare75:
(11-70) nakae néta atemibe
 naka=ené-ta a-tem-Ø-i=be
 man=SG.M I-EMPH 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-PST-1SG.SBJ=DECL
 ‘I (i.e. not you) have seen the man’
(11-71) *nakae né atemibe
 Intended: ‘I have seen the man’
So we have to conclude that should we want to analyze nakae né atemie ‘the man whom
I’ve seen’ in (11-69) as a head-internal relative clause, it would not conform to clausal
syntax. There are two ways out of this situation.

Camling," The prefixes are obligatory with inherently relational nouns (kinship terms, nouns denoting

Bao'an,"2
Standard Mandarin, and various local varieties of Northwest Mandarin (Slater 2003a),
and Bao’an is no exception. The Tongren variety of Bao’an (called “Bao’an Tu” in this
dissertation) in particular has a high degree of lexical borrowing from Amdo Tibetan3 as
well as a speaker perspective system borrowed from Amdo Tibetan, but structurally it
remains an identifiably Mongolic language.
1.1.2 Typological Overview
The dominant word order in Bao’an is SOV.4 Obliques such as NP’s in the locative,
dative, or ablative case, postpositional phrases, and most adverbs typically occur
immediately preceding the verb; but many types of obliques occur in other positions in
the clause as well, often as a result of topic fronting. A list of word order pairings is
given in table 1.1; details and examples of the pairings are given in the relevant chapters
of the dissertation.
3
Wu estimates that 43-54% (depending on the village) of the Bao’an Tu lexicon is borrowed from Amdo
Tibetan (2003:344).
4
The primary criterion I have used to determine this is frequency, but speakers also report that this ordering
is pragmatically neutral.

5.6 Particles
There is one final class of phonologically independent words that do not fit neatly into
any of the previously discussed categories; I will call these particles. There are three
categories of particles plus one particle in a class all its own that are addressed here. First
there are sentence initial particles whose function is to maintain the flow of the discourse.
I call these “discourse connectors”. Second, there are particles that occur sentence
finally. Although they pattern together syntactically, they are diverse in their functions; I
refer to them here as “final particles”. The third set is a class of particles that typically
occur utterance finally, but they differ from final particles in their usage in that they occur
in their own intonation group and can stand alone as an utterance. I call them
“exclamatory particles”. Finally, there is the particle da, which I gloss ‘also’. It modifies
the syntactic unit that immediately precedes it.
5.6.1 Discourse Connectors
Discourse connectors occur sentence initially and function to connect one sentence to
another. The most straightforward discourse connector is su ‘so’. In the sentences prior

1.1.3 Previous Scholarship
The Bao’an language is first mentioned in linguistic literature in Potanin (1893), in which
Bao’an is classified as a Shirongolic variety (Wu 2003:326). The largest linguistic study
of the Tongren variety of Bao’an (i.e. Bao’an Tu) to date was undertaken in 1980-1 by
Chen Naixiong and Wu Hugjiltu. That study resulted in a glossary (Chen 1985), a
volume of language materials (Chen 1986), and a diachronic comparative study (Chen &
Chingeltei 1986). Wu (2003) is a summary based on those publications. Another
publication resulting from that research is a dialectal study (Chen 1994). Previous

This means Bao’an would be classified as Greenbergian type 24 (SOV, Po, GenN, NAdj)(Greenberg
1963), which is anomalous for a Mongolic language (most of which are type 23 (SOV, Po, GenN, AdjN)).
In fact, all of the Mongolic languages for which I could find the relevant data have the relative ordering
Adj,N (these include: Santa (Kim 2003), Mangghuer (Slater 2003a), Mongghul (Georg 2003a), Ordos
(Georg 2003b), Khalkha (Binnick 1979), Buriat (Poppe 1960), Khamnigan Mongol (Janhunen 2003a), and
Dagur (Martin 1961)). Although both orderings occur in Bao’an, N,Adj is dominant. This may be from
Modern Literary Tibetan, which a large majority of Tongren Bao’an speakers are literate in.

I have analyzed the question morpheme as a suffix rather than a particle or clitic, because it is
phonologically part of the word preceding it, and since it occurs at the end of a sentence (and Bao’an is
strictly verb-final), it is always hosted by a verb.

The order of adnominal modifiers in an NP is fixed. As discussed in section 4.4, only
the deictic demonstratives (DEICT) precede the head noun; other modifiers follow the
head noun. The order of modifiers is schematically represented in (98), which is a
repetition of the same scheme given in (67):

knowledge who is able to negotiate and enter various contracts in a culturally recognized way.

Abui,"Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.

Abui," In syntax, Stokhof claims the basic constituent order to be SOV, but frequent
fronting is mentioned (1984:137). In an NP, modifiers follow heads in the order:
attribution, quantification, specification (1984:139). In a clause, the phrases expressing
temporal settings of an event precede the arguments. The sketch provides rich
comparative data with other Alorese languages such as Kabola or Woisika, as well as
Timorese Bunak.
4 Wim Stokhof and Hein Steinhauer carried out a survey of Alor-Pantar languages published in Stokhof
(1975). Stokhof continued working on Woisika (also referred to as Kamang), and also worked on Abui (1984)
and Kabola (1987). Steinhauer focussed on Blagar (Steinhauer, 1986; 1991).

Abui,"INTRODUCTION11
As in other Papuan languages, Abui has a small class of verbs (referred to as
generic verbs in this study) that derive new verbs. This is a feature specific of Papuan
languages (cf. Foley, 2000:386). Generic verbs also frequently combine with other
verbs, and then function as auxiliaries. Abui has no ditransitive verbs and most verbs
may occur in both transitive and intransitive construction. These features are common
among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376-7).
Features of Abui syntax:
(i) basic Actor-Undergoer-Verb (AUV) constituent, pragmatic UAV order
(ii)no adpositions (instead, serial verb constructions are used)
(iii) anaphoric demonstratives follow the noun
(iv)modifiers follow the head noun (only deictic demonstratives precede)
(v) frequent clause chaining without conjunctions
Evaluation: Abui shows clause chaining and tail-head linkage, which are both
commonly found among Papuan languages. It is also very rich in serial verb
constructions. Switch reference, sometimes found in TNG languages (cf. Foley,
2000:384), is not found in Abui. In sum, Abui has many features that are typically
Papuan, but also shares some features with the Austronesian languages of Eastern
Indonesia. There is a possibility that Papuan languages of Alor-Pantar predated the
Austronesian languages (cf. Pawley, 2005-b:100). In that case, it is expected that there
has been diffusion of features from Austronesian to Papuan and vice versa (cf. Klamer
et.al., In press).

 There are varying word orders, whose function is suspected to lie in the area of topi-
cality or focus, as discussed briefly in §§ 4.1, 4.3.1, and 5.2. Not enough is presently
understood about topicality and focus in Edolo to make any definitive statements. As
mentioned in § 3.2.2.2.2.5 there is a morpheme -da, glossed 'DEF' here and elsewhere,
that seems to mark something like definiteness, or perhaps topicality or focus. The
function of -da is not well understood. It is used normally on a syntactic subject, either
transitive, intransitive or, as in example (95), equative.

 Some examples with variant word order are also given in § 4.3.1. There seems to be
quite a bit of freedom in word order with the nominal case marking making grammatical
relations evident, even when word order is changed. Movement seems to primarily
consist of fronting of NPs, either within VP or IP, with verb-final ordering being fairly
rigid (see examples (79) through (85) in § 4.3.1). The motivation for the movement
evidenced has not been determined to date. The only exception observed to date to the

 SYNTAX
7.1GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
In this study, the methods of the structural-typological tradition are
employed when discussing grammatical relations. It is customary in
studies in this approach to examine a number of criteria, such as those
discussed in Keenan's (1976) seminal study on subjects from a cross-
linguistic perspective, although opinions can vary greatly on the ""correct""
methodology, as even a brief overview of the literature shows. 1
This section concentrates on morphological and syntactic aspects of
the notion of subject. Following Sasse (1978) it is assumed that a sub-
ject must be unambiguously encoded in some manner, whether through
morphology (e.g., case marking, predicative morphology), word order, or
through a combination of these. 2 This is to be distinguished from what is
often termed the ""syntactic subject"" Here the notion of ""pivot"" is used to
discuss these syntactic operations individually. In order for a language to
have a syntactic subject in this sense, one will need to show that there is a
""privileged NP"" (Foley & Van Valin, 1985) or, in our terminology, a privi-
leged type of Case-syntagma, which is the pivot for various operations.
This is necessary since even within one and the same language, differ-
ent grammatical operations such as reflexivization, coreferential deletion,
etc., may function along different pivots, and some of these processes
may not be subject to any pivot at all.

Kharia," 5 .1. 2 Definiteness and indefiniteness as grammatical categories
Kharia has no definite articles. To indicate that a referential expression is
to be interpreted as definite there are a number of strategies:
- The use of the oblique case marker with definite direct objects, which
 is restricted to Case-syntagmas with definite reference. With ""indirect""
 objects and adverbials, however, its use is more or less mandatory
 (5.2);
- The use of demonstratives (5.8);
- Word order, with topical, generally definite information preceding
 focused information (7. 7).
On the other hand, to refer to an unspecified, non-definite referential
entity, moJl or ek 'one' is used similarly to an indefinite article in Eng-
lish, as in the following example, where the cave is being referred to for
the first time.
",0,No dominant order,"Based on the information given in the paragraph, there is no clear indication of the dominant word order in the language described in the grammar. Therefore, the correct answer is ""No dominant order"".",No dominant order,0,0,упоминание порядка слов
Kharia,"7.7INFoRMATION STRUCTURE-ToPic, Focus AND CoNSTITUENTORDER
The order of constituents in a Kharia sentence is independent of the func-
tion of the respective constituent, i.e., whether it refers to the subject, object
or an adjunct. The order of these elements is determined purely by their
pragmatic status, with topical and/or activated elements preceding focal/
inactive elements. Thus, while there is a tendency for Case-syntagmas
referring to subjects to appear first in the clause and those referring to
the object to be the last constituent preceding the TAMIPERsoN-syntagma,
this is not necessarily the case and any ordering of the constituents of the
clause is possible.
",1,No dominant order,"Based on the paragraph, the language described in the grammar does not have a dominant word order. Therefore, the correct answer is ""No dominant order"".",No dominant order,0,0,
Kharia,"Kharia is a predominantly agglutinating language, and virtually all
grammatical marking is expressed through enclitics, although there is also
a limited number of derivational suffixes, one prefix and two infixes, one
of which appears either as a prefix or infix. The language is generally
predicate-final, although not rigidly so, and the order of the Case-syntag-
mas (""NPs"") is determined primarily through their pragmatic status, with
topical elements appearing first, followed by focal elements. There are
only two overtly expressed cases, the genitive and the oblique, the latter
being used to mark a variety of argument-types, including (specific
and definite) direct objects, ""indirect objects"", as well as adjuncts of
various types.
",1,No dominant order,"The language described in the grammar is generally predicate-final, although not rigidly so. Therefore, the dominant word order of this language is ""No dominant order"".",No dominant order,0,0,
Kharia," The ""incorporated nominal'' often appears to be the subject or object
of the predicate, as in the following example:
95. si 'plow' (somewhat archaic) si-lo'l 'plow (v.)' (cf. lo'lkha 'earth')
Nevertheless, compounds such as si-lo'l are fully opaque to syntax: Even
though it would appear that the object has been incorporated into the
predicate in (95), as the following example shows, the ""incorporated
object"" is not the object of the clause but rather goljlo'l=te 'the field':
96. hocf.om=ki=ya'l gdjlo'l=tesi-lo'l=na
 other=pr,=oENrice.field=oBLplow-earth==JNF QUAL.PRS
 la'lmadetrema'l=te=ki.
 thenhelp call.for=AcT.PRS=FL
 the rice field of the others must be plowed (= is to plow), then
 they call for help.' [AK 5,13-14]

97. tomle1}=tesu1 b
milk=oBLreach.hand.into
«1_a1=yo1 'He reached his hand into the [bucket of] milk.'
water=ACT.PST
As has long been noted (e.g., Pinnow, 1960: 97), the apparent ""Verb-
Object"" order of these compounds would seem to be a sign of their high
antiquity, deriving from an earlier stage in which the Munda languages,
like the Man-Khmer languages of Southeast Asia today, had the underly-
ing constituent order S-V-0. Nontheless, from a purely synchronic view-
point, these forms are merely contentive morphemes in their own right in
Kharia, not compounds.

Savosavo,"The basic constituent order in a verbal clause is Subject–Object–Verb when the argu-
ments are expressed by full noun phrases. This is, however, rather rare and pragmatically
not neutral. Very often the subjects are expressed by second-position enclitic pronouns,
which can be preceded by an object noun phrase, an adjunct or an adverb. Nonetheless,
Savosavo is a fairly typical SOV-language: suffixing, with postpositions, modifiers usually
preceding the modified and the possessor preceding the possessed. In non-verbal clauses,
the basic constituent order is Subject–Predicate, but predicates are frequently fronted.
",1,SOV,"The dominant word order of the language described in the grammar is ""SOV"" (Subject-Object-Verb), which means that the subject usually comes first, followed by the object and the verb, in a sentence.",SOV,0,0,
Savosavo,"The term ‘basic word order’ or ‘basic constituent order’ is often used in typological and
descriptive works. Applying Greenberg’s criterion for a ‘basic word order’, which is “the
order of nominal subject, nominal object, and verb in declarative sentences” (Greenberg
1966: 80; cf. Dryer 2007), Savosavo has the basic word order Subject – Object – Verb.
Indeed, other structures in the grammar are in accordance with the universals relating
to basic word order directly or indirectly as formulated in Greenberg (1966): the genitive
precedes the governing noun (Universal 2, p. 78), there are postpositions rather than
prepositions (Universal 4, p. 79), there is no invariant rule placing the interrogative word
first in questions (Universal 12, p. 83), and verb forms subordinate to the main verb
precede it (Universal 13, p. 84). Savosavo could therefore be considered a rather well-
behaved SOV-language, but as pointed out above, in affirmative declarative clauses having
overt NPs for subject and object this constituent order is neither a ‘pragmatically neutral’
structure nor is it very frequent; it thus fails to meet many of the criteria set up by other
authors in discussion and application of the concept of ‘basic word order’ (cf. e.g. Brody
1984; England 1991; Mithun 1992; Dryer 1995).

Non-verbal clauses, i.e. clauses with a non-verbal constituent as the predicate, are very
common: in most texts of the corpus, the portion of independent clauses (i.e. clauses
that are not subordinate or cosubordinate clauses) with a nominal predicate is between
40 and 60 %, independent of the text genre.

7.1.1.3 Summary and a note on basic word order
The constituent order in affirmative declarative verbal clauses is quite flexible, although
there is a tendency to have the verb complex at the end, and a restriction that object NPs
always have to precede the verb complex. This flexibility is caused to a large extent by
the possibility to drop object NPs, and by the fixed position of enclitic subject pronouns.

Wiyot," §15. CHARACTER OF THE SENTENCE
A complete Wiyot sentence may consist of a radical with a pro-
nominal suffix, i. e., of a single verb form. A characteristic sentence,
however, might have this order: subject noun, descriptive adjective,
verbal complex. The verbal complex may be composed of the following:
any number of compatible modal prefixes; one or two first-positional
verb stems; an adverbial prefix; nominal, pronominal, or descriptive
classifiers; final-positional verb stem co6rdinate with the preceding;
pronominal object, indirect object, instrumental, reflexive or reciprocal,
and subject, and perchance a modal or syntactic suffix. It is true that
sentences as complete as this do not occur often, but a literal translation
might be: 'handkerchief-interrogative, large abstract thing, intention
-quickly-rub-near eyes13-do with hands-ourselves-we;' mean-
ing: 'are we intending to rub our eyes with a large handkerchief
quickly?' The accompanying tabulation of some actually occurring
verb complexes illustrates the morphological scheme of the verb complex.

nominal instrumentals are present they are obliged to settle down in
their own compartments. There are also elements which have no fixed
position and which in some connections should be treated as independent
words and in others as affixes.

Wiyot,"There is only one method of expressing verbal subordination, namely,
by using the verbal noun with the proper possessive affixes. This
method is used to indicate indefinitive and participial, temporal, condi-
tional, relative and substantival clauses. The independent clause con-
tains the usual subject and object; the latter, in its turn, is subject of
the subordinate clause, a fact which is indicated by the possessive prefix.
Whether a verb is transitive or intransitive, the possessive prefix shows
the subject.

Several exceptions to this rule for relation of subject and object
occur:

times agrees with its object rather than with its subject:

 4. Syntax: General survey
4. 1. Syntactic ty po logy
As noted above, Even, as well as the other Tungusic languages, in general follows a (nominative-)
accusative pattern. Nevertheless, it reveals certain deviations from the overall accusative typology.
On the one hand, Even displays certain ergative features in case-marki ng. First, the direct object
must stand in the (unmarked) nominative case, when followed by a renexive-possessive endi ng (see
3.2.5.). Second, in most Even dialects the Designative case can mark the intransitive subject, apart
from the direct object (see (3.2.5.». On the other hand, Even is reminiscent of ""topic-prominent""
languages in that it makes frequen t use of topicalization. The panicle bim; (historically, the condi-
tional converb of the copula bi-) following the topica lized NP serves as a topicalization marker. To-
picalization in Even applies mostly to subjects and preferably occurs in ""switch-topic"" contexts; cr.,
e.g., geeJuJci bimi 'as for the wolf...' in (I: 20). As regards word order phenomena, Even is also a Iy-
pical ""Altaic"" language, that is, a consistent head-final language. Within a nominal phrase the head
normally follows its modifier(s). Within a clause the basic word order is: SOY. This word order
pattern holds for different types of clauses (both matrix and subordinate) and sentences (declarative,
interrogative, etc.). Thus, as suggested by (3 1), foonation of interrogative (constituent) sentences
does not involve a (syntactic) wh-movement:
(31) Etiken-# ile hor-re-n?
 old man-NOM where go-NONFUT-3SG
 'Where has the old man gone?'

 Otherwise. the present notation follows the conven tions, adopted in (Comrie 1981), which are,

 3. Morphology
 3.1. Introductory
 3.1.1. Word structure
Morphologically, Even is an agglutinating language, using exclusively suffixation. There are
found. however, certain deviations from the strict agglutination.
 On the one hand, Even has developed a certain degree of fusion. Thus, a number of suffixes are
grammatically polysemous, that is encode values of different grammatical categories (cr., e.g., the
suffix -gar in 3.7.4., indicating first person plural inclusive invitation; hor-ger 'Let'S go!'). Further,
there are some in stances, where segmentation into different morphemes is problematic (as the
reader can check fo r himself with regard td'verbal conjugation presented in Table 6). Finally, nouns
and verbs are divided into (phono)morphological classes (cf. distinct innection and conjugation
types).
 On the other hand, Even reveals certain features, characteristic of ""polysynthetic"" languages. Thus,
verbal suffixes (such as the causative marker -wkall-, the directional marker -nat, among others)
have a content corresponding to that of independent words in other languages and also display
some other properties of free morphemes. In particular, whereas the overall order of suffixes is
fixed, the relative o rdering of these suffixes reflects sema ntic differences; cr. (Ia) and ( Ib) below:

 The RC in (77b) is a familiar case of a primary gapping strategy_ It can be considered as an ex-
ternal Re. si nce the domab. noun a) occurs external ly (to the right) of the restrictive clause and b)
constitutes the syn tactic head of the Re. The head-dependent relation is additionally marked here
by number agreement: the domai n (head) nou n is in plural, hence the plural marker -/ on the parti-
cipial modifier. The RC in (77c), by contrast, is internal: a) the domain noun appears within the re-
strictive clause and b) does not head the Re. Note, in particular, that number agreement between
the paniciple a nd the domain noun fails in that case: the domain noun is in the plural, whereas the
partic iple stands in the singular. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that the domain noun oc-
cupies the same position (the DO position) within the RC (77c) and within the restrictive sentence
(77a). Indeed, it retains both its (preverbal) word order position and its (ACC) case marking. In
other words, the internal RC (hencefonh, IRC) is patterned as a sentential argument (subject),
headed by the participiaJ predicate (cf. (22b». On the other hand, semantically, the mc in (77c) is a
canonicaJ relative clause, as aJready suggested by its translation. Indeed, there is fonnal evidence in
favour of the fact that at some (Iogico-semantic?) level of representation of (77c) the RC is headed
by the domain noun. First, the IRC in (77c) is distributionally similar to other RCs (cf. (77b». That
is, it has distribution of an NP, co-occurri ng with verbs, such as desci - 'lie' in (77c), that nomlally
do not take sentential subjects. Second, the domain noun controls person and number agreement of
the matrix predicate: the domain noun untalbu 'shoes' stands in the plural, hence the 3rd person plu-
ral ending -r on the matrix verb. Within the prototype approach to the notion of headed ness,
adopted in the previous chapler, it could be argued that derivation of internal RCs results in a ""spli t""
of head-like propenies among different RC-constituents. In the course of derivation, the domain
noun acquires RC-external head propenies (in particular, control of agreement of the matrix predi-
cate), whereas the panicipiaJ predicate retains Re-intemal head propenies.

Even,"In the light of these criteria for heads let us reconsider the structure of nominal phrases in (60). As
for the structures attested in (6Oa)-(6Oc). the noun is clearly the head of the nominal phrase. Thus. it
is distributionally equivaJent to the phrase (as incidentally in all the other constructions in (60), as
well). The noun is also the obligatory constituent: unlike the attribute, it cannot be omitted without
making the construction ungrammatical. It is the noun that normally occupies the final position in
its phrase. Within (6Oa) and (60b) this o rdering of the NP-constituents is the only word order
available, whereas within (6Oc) it is still the basic word order. (tn some cases the attribute can
undergo inversion.). Further, the noun is invariably the locus of (case-) marking of the NP's
external relations. It takes the ACe case marker to indicate that the NP occupies the DO position
within the matrix sentence. Within (60a) and (60b) it is the only constituent marked for case, while
within (6Oc) it shares this property with the attribute. Finally, in examples (60b) and (6Oc), as
opposed to (60a), subordination within the NP is additionaUy marked by the number agreement: the
noun stands in the plural, hence the plural marker on the attribute as well. Thus. within the nominal
phrase (6Oa)-(6Oc) lbe noun is clearly more head-like lban lbe .,tribute. although in (60a) and (6Oc)
the atuibute also rev~s some head properties. If we now tum to (6Od), the picture is somewhat
different The attribute acquires (and the noun consequently, loses) the following HPs: a) the
attribute moves to the NP-fmal position; b) unlike the noun , the attribute is marked for case; c) the
attribute becomes the obligatory constituent. Nevertheless, the attribute reveals its number
agreement and in this respect is the dependent rather than the head constituent. In the course of
derivation of (6Oe) the underlying NP structure (as iconically represented in (60a)-(6Oc» undergoes
LWfM 1233EVEN
more radical changes. In derivational tenns these changes can be described as follows: the initial
attribute is raised to the head position (hence the term ""Attribute Raising""), whereas the initial head
noun is demoted to Possessor. Indeed , the nominal phrase in (60e) is patterned as a possessive
construction, headed by the attributive participle. In other words, the nominal phrase in (6Oe)
syntactically patterns as a sentential complement in the DO position (eC. (22b)). Whereas the noun
is still the distributional equivalent of its phrase, all the other HPs are assigned to the participial
attribute: it is the obligatory NP-constituent. it occupies the NP·final position and takes the
appropriate possessive and case markers. Within (60f) the nominal phrase is also pauerned as a
sentential compleme nt. It differs syntactically from the nominal phrase in (6Oe) in that the initial
noun here retains its case marking and both NP constituents become optional. The three latter
constructions (6Od)-(60t), where the attribute outranks the noun in head properties, are similar
discourse-pragmatically. Within these constructions the attribute is always pragmatically salient, in
particular, contrastive. Cf. the contrastive attributes within the nominal phrase patterned as (6Od) in

On the o ther hand, the NP structures, found in (60a)-(6Od), are opposed to structures found in
(6Oe). (60t) in that the fonnation of the latter is subject to a number of restrictions. First, the fonner
can occupy different syntactic positions. whereas the latter occur only in the 00 position. Se-
condly, within the fonner the modifier can be expressed by attributes of different classes
(adjectives, participles, numerals, e tc), whereas within the latter exclusively by paniciples.
(Therefore we shall reconsider the latter cases as instances of ""internal relative clauses"" in the next
chapter). Finally, patterns (6Oe), (600, as well as (6Od), are restricted geo-linguistically: the fonner
occur in Middle dialects, the latter in Eastern dialects.

Even,"Even belongs to the Tungusic language family which is under the Altaic phylum
of Ural -Altaic languages. Tungusic is divided into two subfamilies in itself: North and
South Tungusic. Even is a North Tu ngusic language, whose closest relatives are Evenki
and Negidal (Please see Figure 1 for a family tree). Being a Ural -Altaic language, Even
displays many of the characteristics other languages of this phylum have such as
agglutination, SOV word order, vowel harmony, a complex case system, and
postpositions. We’ll explore these in the later parts of the paper, but first start with the
phonology of Even.

Onur Mutlu
c4. Back to Agglutination
As mentioned befo re, Even is an agglutinating language. This characteristic can
be seen clearly in the following phrase:
(10) d’uu – l – dula – tan
 house-PL-LOC-3PL
 “in their houses”
Clearly, each suffix adds its own meaning to the word and by that waythe
meaning of the word changes. The above example also shows us the ordering of suffixes
on the noun: {noun stem}{plural suffix}{case marker}{possession marker}
In the examples we have seen so far, it is always the case that the added suffix
adds its meaning to the word it is added to. This agglutinative feature of Even is again
evident in the verb of example (21), maawran, which has taken 3 suffixes which have
added their meanings.-w is the passive morpheme (see voice and valency altering
suffixes part), -ra is the nonfuture suffix, and-n is the third person singular subject
marker.
d. Adjective agreement
In Even adjectives agree in number and case with the noun. In some special cases
they can agree in posession as well.

Even,"(11) Enj – l – bu beji – l – buemu – re - m
 strong-PL-ACCman-PL-ACCbring-NONFUTURE-1SG
 “I brought back the strong men”
In sentence 11, the adjective enj agrees with the noun it qualifies, beji in number
and case ( both are marked with plural and accusative suffixes). However, the agreement
rules are complex and agreement is only sometimes compulsory. For example, the
following sentences have the exact same meaning as (11):
7
Onur Mutlu
(12) (a) Enj beji – l – buemu – re – m
 strong man-PL-ACC bring-NONFUTURE-1SG
 “I brought back the strong men”
 (b) Enj – lbeji – l – buemu – re – m
strong-PL man–PL–ACC bring – NONFUTURE-1SG
“I brought back the strong men”
Adjective agreement is therefore complicated and compulsory only in certain
cases that are out of the scope of this paper. However, it is interesting to see that this
“optional agreement” may function as an indicator of the importance of the adjective in
the sentence (see Malchukov, p. 32).
e. Subject Agreement
 In Even, the subject is marked on the verb (both person and number). The subject
markers are distinct for different tense/mood categories , which we will no t deal with in
this paper (Tense and mood was not explained well in my sources). Some examples of
subject markers are as follows:
(13) Ora – r - ∅ - san berge – lbi – si – ten
reindeer-PL-NOM-2PL fat-PLbe-PAST-3PL
“Your reindeer were fat”
rd
In (13), we see that the verb is added the –ten suffix to agree with the 3 person
plural subject. The subject marker of the 3rd plural person is different for the nonfuture:
(14) nina – l - ∅meen meen - ∅ - ur itme – r
dog-PL-NOMbite – NONFUTURE:3PL
“The dogs bit each other”
Subject markers for 1st singular and 3rd singular persons for the nonfuture can also
be seen in sentences (3), (4), (5), (11), (12). The subject agreement markers for the
nonfuture are shown in Table 5:
8
Onur Mutlu
1st singular-m
2nd singular-nri
3rd singular-n / -ni
1st plural (exclusive)-ru / -u
1st plural (inclusive)-p
2nd plural-s
3rd plural-r
 Table 5: Subject markers on the verb for the nonfuture.
f. Voice and valency-altering affixes
In Even the active voice is unmarked. There are five voice forms which affect the
verbal valency: medio -passive, reciprocal, causative, adversative (-passive), and sociative
(Malchukov, p.14). The reciprocal form denotes mutual actions as can be seen in the
following sentences:
(15) Ak – nil - ∅ aw – mat – ta
 brother-PL-NOM wash-REC-NONFUT:3PL
 “The brothers washed each other”
(16) Ak – nil - ∅meer niri – l - ∅ - buraw – mat – ta
 brother-PL-NOM self’s back-PL-NOMREF POS PL wash-REC-NF3PL
 “The brothers washed each other’s backs”
In these sentences, the reciprocal morpheme changes the object of the action by
making it the subjects (mutually) themselves (in (15)) or by changing the objects (back)
possessed by the subjects (brothers – in (16)).

Even," 5
Onur Mutlu
(6) d’uu d’uu – l (7) oran ora – r
“house”“houses” “reindeer” “reindeers”
Exceptions to this “plural marker rule” exist. Usually kinship terms take special
plural markers –sal/-sel, -tal/-tel, -nil. For example,
(8) aman (“father”) am-til (“fathers”)
c3. Possession markers
Nouns in Even are marked for possession. These markers are either personal or
reflexive. Due to space considerations, I will not deal withthese markers in detail. The
possessive markers are different for each type of noun class. The possessive paradigm for
a class 1 noun (d’uu) would be as follows:
(9) d’uu – w (my house)
d’uu – s (your(singular) house)
d’uu – n (his/her/its house)
d’uu – wun (our house – including the person who is being spoken to)
d'uu - t (our house - exclusive first person plural)
d’uu – san (your(pl) house)
d’uu – tan (their house)
In marking the nouns for possession Even is very similar to Turkish, which is also
an Altaic agglutinating language that has an SOV word order, makes use of a case system
(though not as complicated as Even) and exhibits vowel harmony. In Turkish the
possessive paradigm for ev (“house”) would be:
(9a) ev – im (my house)
 ev – in (your(sg) house)
 ev – i (his/her/its house)
 ev – imiz (our house – Turkish has only one type of first person plural)
 ev – iniz (your(pl.) house)
 ev – leri (their house)
 ev – iniz (your(sg.)(formal) house)
We need to contrast these two languages with English. In English, possession is
not marked on nouns, instead possessive pronouns are used for indicating the possessor.

“Evens made Kaddak drink the wine”
In (18) the causative morpheme has added another subject (the causee) to the
sentence and the original subje ct of sentence (17) became the direct object of (18).
Hence, the causative both increased the numerical valency and changed the valency
pattern of the verb.

SYNTAX
Wyandot morphology is highly structured and tightly organized. That is, there are

 fixed, and even what constitutes a single utterance is unclear.

 sort order for entries within a category (e.g., there is no distinction alphabetically between
 <e> and <£>, although these are kept distinct in transcription). Alphabetical order is often
 ignored, and laryngeals might or might not be considered in the alphabetizing. Inconsistencies
 abound, both within and across entries. A root may appear with different renderings in
 different examples, beyond standard Iroquoian morphophonemics. The same single example

 Verbal Prefixes

 important ones are:

 hi-po'na, he strikes it (plays harp)
 yore-, indefinite personal object
 ne-, indefinite personal object. (Used only with the verb sawe, command)
 a-, am-, definite personal object. These are tantamount to being the singular
 and plural of the third personal pronominal object. They are, however, the
 only persons thus prefixed and probably are not entitled to be considered
 as pronouns. They are used only when the nominal plural is not mentioned,
 or when it lies far distant from the verb. The pronominal subject, a definite
 pronoun, may be interpollted between these and the verb stem.

These examples seem to be integral prefixes of the verb complex,
but Velasco states as one of his most infallible rules, that the pro-
nominal subject must be the second word or element in the sentence,3
so that, if the sentence contains only verb stem and pronominal sub-
ject, the latter follows the verb stem. At other times it is absolutely
separate from the verb as, to give his example, cate Diosta suale,
""Not-thou God-in believest?"" in which -(t)e is the semipronoun of
the second person singular. So unexceptionable is this rule, accord-
ingf to Velasco, that the semipronoun will fall between what cannot
but be considered as inltegral parts of the verb complex, as cot-ne-vare,
""Sleep-I-wish;"" am-ne-eria, ""Them-I-love."" Grammatical classifica-
tion is at best an academic question, but it is difficult to classify
-elements, apparently enclitics of some kind, which may stand either
after a verb stem, between a verb stem and its morphological suffixes,
or be separated from the verb by means of a noun with postposition
or case-ending, as in the above examples. Other examples, with the
elements in the order given, are: ""Here I tomorrow will-come"" and
""Tomorrow I here will-come.""
 The pronominal subject is, then,. best considered as independent
or at best enclitic to any part of speech. These semipronouns are:
 Singular Plural
1. ne te
2. eem
3. (nothing)im
 The pronominal object, of which the writer has no certain examples
in his notes, appears, judging from Velasco, to be not expressed in
the verbal complex. Velasco gives no semipronouns for the objective
 forms, as he does for the subjective and possessive relations, but
 implies that the pronominal object is always expressed by the accusa-
 tive form of the independent pronoun.

Seri," The diagram in Figure 2.1 is obviously much simpler than trees that are commonly drawn
for clauses in other languages. Perhaps compelling motivation exists in Seri for a more
articulated structure, including a verb phrase that includes at least the direct object, but such
motivation has not been found yet.1
 Discussion of the verb phrase itself is reserved for chapter 5. The verb phrase essentially
includes the verb and some tightly associated adverbs and nominals including the reflexive
pronouns.
2.1 Subjects
In the absence of a simple adjunct (see §2.7.1), basic word order places an overt subject first in
the clause. It therefore precedes the verb phrase, as in (6)-(8), or the predicate nominal, as in (4)
above.
1
Until that time, an appropriate strategy is to work without such a structure. On the order of the various nominal
phrases, see Culicover and Jackendoff (2005:130) where it is argued that it is possible to appeal simply to linear
order, with arguments preferably occurring in a particular order, but with that preference being “defeasible” by
other factors.

 Example (3) is also an appropriate example to illustrate the basic SOV order of constituents
in the clause; the subject precedes the complement of the verb. While there is certainly some
freedom of word order, it does not seem to be the case that the language should be classified as a
“free word order” language. There are strategies for placing nominals to the left and to the right
of the basic clausal elements, but one would not characterize these as “scrambling”.

Lepcha," CHAPTER THREE
PARTS OF SPEECH
 3
Lepcha distinguishes nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns,
numerals, postpositions, suffixes, conjunctions and particles. Nouns
refer to objects, entities and individuals, and express the subject or
object of verbs. Verbs describe states, events and actions, and relate to
the referents of noun phrases. Adjectives modify nouns, while ad-
verbs modify verbs to specify the time, manner, place or direction of
the event described by the verb. Adverbs may also modify adjectives
or other adverbs. Suffixes and postpositions express a range of se-
mantic relations between the parts of speech they attach themselves to
or combine with. Conjunctions are used to connect or combine words,
phrases, clauses or sentences. Particles add a semantic notion to a
whole sentence. Nouns, pronouns, adjectives and numerals comprise
the group of nominals which may be pluralised and take nominal suf-
fixes or postpositions. Verbs may be marked by auxiliary verbs and
take verbal suffixes. A small group of suffixes and particles is used to
mark nouns, verbs and whole sentences.

Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between compounds and juxta-
posed elements, e.g. ivm+ vimân ‘kin, offspring, relatives' (literally
‘flesh and blood’), hNaOlN hánlon ‘not simultaneously' (literally ‘before
and after’).
3.4 Reduplication
Lexical reduplication yields adverbials of time, e.g. nMa nám ‘year’,
nManMa námnám ‘yearly’, tos tasó ‘yesterday', osos sósó ‘lately'. This
process is different from the syntactic reduplication of words in collo-
quial speech, e.g. tU tú ‘who’, tUtU tútú ‘such as who’, ‘who exactly’,
sba sabá ‘where’, sbasba sabásabá ‘such as where’, ‘where ex-
actly’, which may well be an areal phenomenon influenced by Nepali.
3.5 Causative verbs
Lepcha causatives express transitive notions derived from intransitive
meanings or causative motions derived from a base meaning. In the
former cases, the subject of the intransitive verb, e.g. ‘die’, ‘stay’,
corresponds to the object of the derived transitive verbs, e.g. ‘kill’,
‘keep’. In the latter cases, the semantic relationship between the two
verbs connected by means of this now defunct morphological process
is more subtle, e.g. ‘push’ vs. ‘cause to quiver’. A closed class of
causative verbs is derived by palatalisation of the initial consonant of
the base verb. Lepcha native orthography, as reflected in most trans-
PARTS OF SPEECH45
literation and transcription systems, uses the symbol y representing
the affixed glide /y/ to indicate palatalisation of consonants, as in À
kya [kja], È pya [pja]. The palatal nasal [ɲ], however, is written in
Lepcha orthography with the consonant sign J, which is transliterated
here as /ny/. Some examples of causative verbs and the verbs they are
derived from by palatalisation of the initial consonant are listed here.
!nnók‘push’
!J nyók‘cause to quiver, shake’
mXa mák‘die’
ÌXa myák ‘kill’
bMa bám‘dwell, stay, reside’
ËMa byám ‘keep, leave behind’

ÎU lyú ‘erect'
AMu ʔum‘ripe, sweet, tasty’
ÜMu ʔyum ‘ripen, bring to maturity’
ÃLutyul‘fall’
ÃLa tyal ‘fell' (also spelt tLe tel)
When the stem of the root verb ends in a vowel, in some cases a final
/t/ is added to the derived causative, viz. xU glú ‘fall down’, ÔD glyat
(also spelt xDe glet) ‘drop, decline, suspend’ and bu bu ‘carry’, bDe bet
‘load’.

A verb marked by the ablative suffix nNu ~ nu -nun ~ -nu expresses a

Lepcha,"The order of the Lepcha alphabet as given in the lVoz lazóng, is
different to the order in which the Lepcha alphabet is taught and read
out today. The original Lepcha syllabary was built out of five units, as
given below in Diagram 4, the first units running from A ʔa to m ma,
and the second unit running from h ha to T tha, etc. Although most
lVoz lazóng books use the same order, occasionally there is some
variation in the order of the units. A similar conclusion was pointed to
by R. K. Sprigg in his article ‘Original and sophisticated features of
the Lepcha and Limbu scripts’ (Sprigg 2003). The order of the conso-
nant symbols within the five units may vary slightly between different
versions of the lVoz lazóng, between the introductory summary of the
alphabet in the opening part of lVoz lazóng and the actual listing of all

 Diagram 4: Original order of the syllabary
In the lVoz lazóng, all the orthographic symbols and combinations
of symbols are treated in a specific order, building from simple con-
sonant or vowel signs to more complex syllables. Apart from a few
paragraphs which introduce the different sections making up the
book, the lVoz lazóng does not contain running text as such. The tradi-
tional method of instruction is for the teacher to recite sections of the
lVoz lazóng in a set melody and for the students to read and chant
along with the teacher, until the students have memorised the values
of the letters and the syllables and are able to read and to recite by
themselves. Although most people nowadays learn to read and write
Lepcha through primers and textbooks based on different methods,
the traditional method based on recitation of the lVoz lazóng is still
practised. The list of possible syllables in Lepcha given by Mainwar-
ing in his grammar (1876: 12-18), is clearly based on the lVoz lazóng.
The order of the syllabary that is mostly used in primers and text-
books today, clearly influenced by the order of the devanāgarī alpha-
bet, is given in Diagram 5 below, starting with k ka, K kha, g ga, G
nga, and ending with E bla, I mla, H hla.

4.4 The ablative suffix
The invariant meaning of the ablative suffix nNu ~ nu -nun ~ -nu is
source or cause. Lepcha nNu ~ nu -nun ~ -nu is cognate with the Limbu
comitative suffix -nu ‘with, from', which also fulfils an ablative func-
tion. Lepcha nNu ~ nu -nun ~ -nu is suffixed to nominals, verbs or
clauses and the apparently different types of meaning which the mor-
pheme nNu ~ nu -nun ~ -nu expresses in these combinations are a func-
tion of the difference in the syntactic status of the constituent to which
the morpheme is attached.

How Relative Clauses
 Clauses are Used
In the last lesson, we learned a relative clause is a group of words with a verb that
describes or identifies a noun. It has the same use as a demonstrative phrase with a
verb. Both a demonstrative phrase with a verb and relative clause tell about a noun.
But a relative clause usually has more words than a demonstrative phrase with a verb.
The noun described by the relative clause can be the subject, object, or introduced by a
preposition in the sentence. The noun can also be the subject, object, or introduced by a
prepostion, or described by a prepositional phrase in the relative clause.
Relative clauses can identify nouns used as subjects, objects, or introduced by
prepositions. For each use, they can show the noun is definite or known.

Relative connectors can describe an implied noun. In Sek 14-15, the relative connector

At the beginning of this story we learn Lükä has wajik saꞌare saꞌare marek ꞌtwo girl childrenꞌ.
The connector kunene ꞌwhichꞌ in Sek 14, describes some of those children.
Sometimes the relative clause and the noun it describes are a full sentence by
themselves. There is no verb in the sentence, but only in the relative clause. This
happens when the described noun is in focus, that is, the most important part of the
sentence.
In Kam 27-28, the noun sek ꞌpeopleꞌ is identified by a relative clause.

many adjectives and nouns. Verbs are introduced in Chapter 5; the following chapter,
‘Expanding the verb stem’, discusses the rich array of prepronominal prefixes and

NOTES
 CHAPTER 3
1
Scancarelli warns that ‘It must be borne in mind that sentences with two transitive
verbs and two NP arguments[participants] , especially sentences in which the two
arguments are animate and equally ranked on the animacy hierarchy, are extremely
rare in Cherokee…’ (1987:192). For this reason it is important to base studies of word
order involving naturally-elicited texts. The appendix of this grammar contains two
‘race’ narratives, each involving a pair of animals. These texts present a wide variety
of word orders, depending on which animal is being foregrounded or backgrounded;
these different pragmatic roles are often signaled by the attachment of clitics. The
complex phenomenon of word order in Cherokee is a topic deserving of its own
independent study.
2
Dukes (1996) explores the interaction of this pronominal agreement with the
Cherokee Animacy Hierarchy proposed by Scancarelli and argues that a lexically
based analysis that takes into consideration semantic and pragmatic factors is more
appropriate for Cherokee than a purely syntactic approach. He supports this claim
through a discussion of ditransitive verbs, using a framework from both Relational
Grammar and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar.
3
 King (1975:111) observes that North Carolina Cherokee word order is relatively
free except for cases where both subject and object are third person and the same
number. He claims that in such situations the subject must precede the object.
4
King points out that ‘standing alone in a subordinate clause the participle often
translates to English as an adjective’ (1975:117). Scancarelli (1987:325) refers to
these constructions as ‘event nominals.’

CHAPTER 4: PRONOMINAL PREFIXES
1. OVERVIEW
In Cherokee all verbs must have a prefix that indicates who or what is
involved in the action of the verb. If the verb is intransitive, this suffix will refer to
one participant- the subject. If the verb is transitive, the prefix will refer to two
participants-a subject and an object. Some adjectives and nouns also have these
prefixes. A prefix on an adjective refers to an entity that has the quality indicated by
the adjective. A noun with a pronominal prefix will either indicate an entity
equivalent to that noun (e.g. ‘You are a man’, in which ‘man’ equals ‘you’) or who
possesses the noun (e.g. ‘your head’). In the first case the prefix has a referential
meaning; in the second it has a possessive meaning. These terms will be discussed in
greater depth in the following sections.

Pulte and Feeling (1975:301) have a different interpretation of this phenomenon,
which they refer to as the ‘second passive’; the ‘first passive’ is their term for what is
in this grammar called the Object Focus prefixes. For example, they use an English
passive in their translations for the sentence in (58). The verb ‘to see’ is a Set A verb
in the Present Continuous stem and therefore typically takes a Set A prefix a- for
third person subjects with third person objects. Pulte and Feeling (1975:353) consider
Cherokee to have a basic word order of Subject-Object-Verb (SOV); the use of the
Set B prefix uu- seems to indicate a reordering of what they consider a basic word
order and a subsequent focus on the object; hence their use of the English passive. In
Scancarelli’s examples in (57) the word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).

It seems that the interpretation by Pulte and Feeling of this special use of uu- is
markedly different from that of Scancarelli (1987). Scancarelli’s characterization of a
 197
word order determined by pragmatic factors undermines claims of ‘basic’ word
orders. A thorough study of the use of the inverse, therefore, requires a
comprehensive discourse analysis of a large number of Cherokee texts. In other
words, it is difficult to properly understand what is actually going on in example (58)
without seeing this sentence within the larger context of a discourse and how the
factor of ‘newsworthiness’ described in Chapter 3 influences both the word order and
interpretation. While such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present work, the
reader should bear in mind the important role of contextual factors in determining the
identity of subjects and objects of verbs.
4. COMBINED
4.1. BASIC PARADIGM
A fourth set of prefixes reference two local persons. This set is used on
transitive verbs, kinship terms, and some transitive verbs that have been turned into
nouns. Four examples are in (59); the first two are with the Present Continuous stem
of the verb, and the second two are with the Completive stem. Most of these prefixes
trigger laryngeal alternation for most speakers.

An example of a Combined prefix on a kinship term is in (60). Note that the kinship
relationship involves two grammatical persons, just as the transitive verbs do.

 ‘You, boy, are my son.’
 Some of these prefixes have elements similar to prefixes for just one person,
but they have become fused together and must be treated as a unit. It is apparent that
these prefixes were originally formed from the Set B prefixes. They are called
Combined person prefixes (or ‘portmanteau’ prefixes in linguistic terminology) and
are listed in Table 6. The column on the left represents the combination of subject and
object; while the top row indicates number. Because these prefixes are combinations
of first and second person, there is no inclusive/exclusive distinction (that is, all of the
first person readings are logically exclusive).
TABLE 6: COMBINED PRONOMINAL PREFIXES

 object are Singular object is Dual object is Plural

2nd Person Object
 199
The two possible combinations are first person as the subject and second person as
the object or second person as the subject and first person the object. As with the
other prefixes, the Combined prefixes have singular, dual, and plural forms. The two
factors of number and person combine to create six Combined person prefixes. The
two prefixes exemplified above in (59a) and (59b) each have only one possible
interpretation: thus ski- in (59b) always means second person singular is the subject
and first person singular is the object. In (61) the conjugated Cherokee verb has three
possible English translations. This prefix also triggers laryngeal alternation.

stvv-kahthiiya
1/2.DL-wait.for:PRC
‘I am waiting for you two.’
‘We two are waiting for you two.’
‘We two are waiting for you.’
The plural combined form in (62) has five possible meanings. As in the previous
example, this prefix triggers laryngeal alternation.
62) i;gTy

‘I am waiting for you all.’
‘We two are waiting for you all.’
‘We all are waiting for you.’
‘We all are waiting for you two.’
‘We all are waiting for you all.’
What remains constant in the meaning are the two persons-first and second person-
and the relationship between them-first person acting on second person. The number
specification, however, can apply to either or both persons.

Cherokee,"Scancarelli has applied Mithun’s conceptof
‘newsworthiness’ to Cherokee and states that ‘the most newsworthy elements come
earlier in the sentence’ (Scancarelli 1987:192-3). Elements are ‘newsworthy’ when
they introduce important new information or topics or when they indicate a contrast
with other elements in the sentence (Mithun 1987:325). Placing the newsworthy
elements earlier is known as ‘foregrounding.’
In (5) the verb is preceded by two noun phrases, a primary object ‘finger’ and
a secondary object ‘ear.’ The verb is marked for third person singular, with a
Distributive (DST) prefix indicating that the primary object is plural. Both noun
phrases are plural; in this case it is probably real-world knowledge that is making
clear the relations; i.e. it is more common to stick fingers in ears than vice-versa,
therefore ‘fingers’ is the primary object.. In (5b) the nominal phrase ‘him running
over the first mountain’ appears first, followed by the main verb ‘he saw.’ The subject
‘rabbit’ appears at the very end of the sentence.

Word order in Cherokee is thus extremely flexible because it is sensitive to contextual
factors such as the relative newness, importance, definiteness, or animacy of the
participants.2 Throughout this grammar many examples will be presented that have
been taken from larger discourses; the varying word order in any given example
should be seen within the larger context from which it is taken. Three sample
discourses are provided at the end of this grammar in Chapter 9; the reader is invited
to refer to these texts to understand the context from which the sample sentences are
taken. For example, in (5b) the citation indicates that the sentence is from the third
text in Chapter 9 and is found on line 26.

CHAPTER 3:GENERAL STRUCTURE OF CHEROKEE
1. WORD ORDER
1.1. GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS, ANIMACY, AND WORD ORDER
Many languages have what is referred to as a basic word order. English, for
example is described as an SVO language: a subject followed by a verb and an object
(e.g. ‘He reads the book’ or ‘I like Cherokee’). The idea of ‘basic’ word order is
problematic in Cherokee. While there are word orders that are more common than
others, it appears that, given the right context, most word orders are possible. This
variability is the result of the way in which Cherokee indicates on the verb the
participants (the subject and objects) involved in the verb. European languages to
varying degrees have suffixes on the verb that indicate what the subject of the verb is,
while objects are indicated by free-standing nouns or pronouns. Thus in those
languages transitive verbs (verbs with subjects and objects) always require an
independent word (the object) to complete the meaning. In Cherokee such free-
standing words are not necessary as the verb supplies enough information to stand on
its own as a complete sentence. Prefixes indicate the participants involved, while
suffixes indicate the tense, aspect, and mood of the verb. The prefixes do not always
indicate, however, exactly who the subject and the object of the sentence are. For
example, in the English sentence ‘he saw me’ it is readily understood that the ‘he’ is
the subject (the see-er) and ‘me’ is the object (the person being seen). The Cherokee
equivalent of the simple sentence is ambiguous, as seen in (1).
1) afqHi
aakikoohvvi
aki-kooh-vvi
1B-see:CMP-EXP
‘He/she/it saw me.’ or ‘I saw it.’
116
In this example the stem (see:CMP) and suffix indicate that an event of seeing took
place (The abbreviation CMP indicates that the verb is in a form referring to a
completed event, and the Experienced Past suffix, orEXP,indicates a past event of
which the speaker has direct knowledge). The prefix is a Set B first person singular
prefix (1B) prefix (‘I’/ ‘me’). This prefix does not itself indicate if its referent is a
subject or an object. Sentences do not typically exist in isolation, however, and the
context in which the sentence finds itself will help to determine the meaning.
Consider the example in (2).
2) n u>Dc fCafqHi
 na uuleesoot kiihl aakikoohvvi
 na uu-aleesootakiihliaki-kooh-vvi
 that 3B-skinny dog 1B-see:CMP-EXP
 ‘The skinny dog saw me.’
In this sentence only one interpretation is possible, and the prefix on the verb only
refers to the participant that is being seen; i.e. the object. This interpretation is no
longer ambiguous because of the importance of animacy and the local person/non-
local person distinction in Cherokee grammar. While aki- has multiple
interpretations, other prefixes have clear meanings that are related to whether one of
both of the participants is living. Thus to obtain the meaning ‘I saw the skinny dog’
the prefix jii- is required; this single prefix indicates that a first person singular
participant is the subject (‘I’) and a third person animate (‘him’, ‘her’ or animate ‘it’)
is the object. This sentence is presented in (3).
3) n u>Dc fCGqvi
 na uuleesoot kiihl jiikovvi
 na uu-aleesootakiihlijii-kooh-vvi
 that 3B-skinny dog 1A.AN-see:CMP-EXP
 ‘I saw that skinny dog.’
117
Animacy is thus crucial to distinguishing the subjects and objects of a Cherokee
sentence. It is important to emphasize that when a verb is transitive (with a subject
and an object), it will often indicate its participants solely through its prefixes; no
other words are necessary to produce a grammatically complete sentence. When a
noun phrase does appear, the interaction of animacy and the type of pronominal
prefix on the verb will determine if this noun phrase is the subject or object of the
verb.

Zuni," The usual word order is subject—object —verb, but this is not
fixed. Hence there is a slight ambiguity in all sentences which do
not employ other means for distinguishing subject and object, and
this ambiguity may be used for literary effect. See ""Zuni Ritual
Poetry ""1 for a discussion of this point. Adjectives always follow the
nouns they modify, but adverbial clauses occupy first position, with
the connective, if any, following the clause.

 named. The negative when present forms part of this complex.
",,SOV,,,0,0,
Zuni,"The exphcit differentiation of
subject and object isnot a grammatical requirement except in
cases of ambiguity. Usually it can be inferred from word order,
from indications in the verb, or from the general context. The
usual word order is subject, object, verb. Frequently the object is
incorporated into the predicative complex. It is never necessary
to express by explicit means the subject of an intransitive verb.
A noun in juxtaposition is assumed to be the subject.
 mi- lo-oTfdn-a, the ears of corn will be hard 416: 14
 s^an tsita teWtokwin kivatonan, so her mother will go into the
other room 415:8
Similarly a noun juxtaposed to a transitive verb, if no independ-
ent pronouns are used, is assumed to be the subject of the verb,
the object being inferred to be an unexpressed third person:
 Napalu cemakd, Napalu sent for him 400:11
 halikwi ainakd, the witch killed her 402:37
The expression of case in the pronoun is obligatory, so that when an
independent pronoun is used as subject or object, the pronoun
 33
 498BUNZEL ZUNI
 bears the burden of syntactic expression and tiie noun completes
 the sentence.
e. g., ho^ patcu ainakd, I killed a Navajo (ho^, subjective
 pronoun see ^ 137)
aktsik horn yaktokd, the boy struck me
fo^n atine-na, he will tell you (t^o^n < fo'na, objective pronoun)
onaki horn anapekd, the young woman scolded me
 However, where the subject is an unnamed third person, or
where two nouns are used as subject and object, ambiguity may be
avoided by the use of the demonstrative suffix -^ona, the one, (cf.
agentive and relative clauses, and verbal nouns in -^ona), affixed
to the object.
eHactoh'ona le^anihra, he said this to the girl (to her)
(cf. eHactok le^anikwa, the girl said this to him)
patcu ainakd, the Navajo killed him

Zuni," The common sequence in a clause, then, is: 1) clause and predicate modi-
fiers in the form of particles, 2) subject substantive, 3) object substantive,
and 4) verb complex of predicate. In a close-knit predicate construction, modi-
fiers and complements immediately precede their governing verb; otherwise,
they may appear earlier in the clause (13.211-15.212). Within a substantive
the usual order is for complements and modifying particles or pronouns to
precede their governing term, for other modifiers to follow it.
",,SOV,,,0,0,
Zuni,"Incorporated substantives may function as subjects of the verb as well as
 objects: in ^as ""Vw-allu-kka (hand\s\ they-moved-about) he felt about with
 his hands, the prefix ?a*w- indicates that ?as < ?asi (noun class 1) hand is a
plural subject, for the verb vallu (class 7) to move about is intransitive.
Even though the plural element is a verb prefix, it may be attached to the
substantive in order to pluralize the total construction: compare the preceding
example with ?a*w-as ""Vw-allu-kka they felt about with their hands. When
nouns are the incorporated substantives, they are usually not inflected for
number, as in the preceding examples of an incorporated subject or in the
following incorporated object: ?i-we taku-ka he wore the fur pieces around his
neck, containing ?i- reflexive (a verb prefix), we (noun class 1) fur of small
animal, taku (verb class 9a) to wear around the neck, -ka past. In some in-
stances incorporated nouns take inflectional suffixes, but the cases are too few
to permit the conditions for this practice to be determined: la'k9 susk ?a'-tuna-*
lupc^i-nna-o' today coyotes have yellow eyes, in which the verb complex con-
tains V - plural subject (a verb prefix), tuna (noun class 1) eye, -(V)'

is always the final clause. In any type of clause the verb is always the terminal
word. It is axiomatic, then, that an object complement precedes its verb.
Following the same sequence, a complement in an expanded substantive always
precedes its governing substantival term (15.222).

Ordos,"The other three finite forms all refer to the past tense, but they have functional dif-

action or process, while the resultative carries the additional information that the speaker
is sure (knows well, has no doubts) that the predication is true, cf. e.g. [question, unver-
ified] yabu-b=uu (with the question particle =UU) ‘did he go?; has he gone?’ vs.
[answer, verified] yabu-ji ‘he went; he did go; he has gone’. The confirmative, finally, is
close to a true perfect in that it describes a past action or process of which the conse-
quences are still relevant for the moment of speaking: ire-lee ‘he has come (and is now
here)’, ter gerteen kari-laa ‘he went back home (and is now there)’. As in Mongol proper,
it may also (with first person reference) be used to express the firm intent of the speaker
to do something: bi yabu-laa ‘I am just about to go’ (literally: ‘I have gone’).
SYNTAX
Throughout Ordos syntax, the head-final word order is observed. Thus, for instance, adjec-
tival nouns, numerals, genitive attributes and pronominal specifiers precede their nominal
headwords, e.g. tere nege minggan saikan mori ‘those one thousand beautiful horses’. Also,
subordinate clauses (both converbial and participial) are placed before the finite main
clause. The constituents of a complex noun phrase do not agree in case or number, only the
head being marked, e.g. (abl.) tere nege minggan saikan morin-oos. A corollary of these
principles is the strictly observed SOV-order of sentential constituents. An indirect object
precedes a direct object, as in ter nadad bicig biciji ‘he wrote me a letter’.

conv. contemp. (‘immediately when’) gerteen kari-magca nadad bicig ilgee ‘right after

yabuyaa ‘I will go after having eaten’, yabu-saar arban negen üdür bolji ‘eleven days

kelebe ‘after he had found and interrogated (them), the six brothers said’. The successive
and precedentive converbs may be found with a conditional meaning as well, e.g. conv.
succ. (‘if’) ci ese ire-külee, bi icikü-güee ‘if you don’t come, I won’t go’; conv. preced.

uu-k-aar irelee ‘he has come (in order) to drink tea’.
FINITE INDICATIVE FORMS
Ordos has four finite indicative temporal-aspectual forms, which correspond to the
Common Mongolic durative, terminative, confirmative, and resultative forms (Table 9.9).
The durative and terminative markers have variants with or without a final long
vowel. From the point of view of the morphological system it is interesting to note that
the resultative marker is identical with the marker of the imperfective converb (both -Ci).

Tuvan," We interpret low pitch as having a single articulatory target, with the subsequent
pitch transition representing an updrift towards modal pitch. We have argued that low pitch
appears to have an event-determined, intrinsic length which does not precisely match the
duration of either long or short vowels in all contexts. As such, the low pitch
plateau—which lasts about as long as a typical syllable—may carry over into the second
syllable in order to achieve the necessary duration.

3.1 Demonstratives
The basic set of demonstratives in Tuvan consists of the lexemes bo ‘this one’, ol
‘that one’ (distal), and doûoû (~ duûuû ~ duu ~ doo) ‘that one over there’ (more distal).
Definiteness may be marked on subjects and indirect objects by using one of these
demonstratives. On direct objects, definiteness is expressed by accusative case marking (see
2.1.2).

3.4 Indefinite pronouns
Tuvan possesses several types of indefinite pronominal forms. One form employs
bir ‘one’ plus the emphatic enclitic /=lA/, followed by a noun.
(89)bir-le kizËi bir-le cËuvû e
‘one’=EMPH person‘one’=EMPH thing
‘someone’‘something’
An interrogative pronoun followed by enclitic [=bir] ‘one’ followed by a noun also yields
an indefinite meaning.

3.5Quantitative pronouns
 Common quantitative pronouns include cËamdìk ‘some’, buûruû ‘each, every’ and a
universal quantifier sËuptu ‘all’. These may bear possessive and case marking.

4.0Adjectives
 Adjectives precede nouns in Tuvan. Many lexemes double as both nouns and
modifiers, e.g. demir ‘iron’ (noun or adjective), dasË ‘stone’, ìyasË ‘wood(en)’, tìva
‘Tuva(n)’.
(95) tìva kizËibicËii eÁrgi bazËìÑ
 ‘Tuvan’ ‘person’‘small’ ‘old’ house’
 ‘a Tuvan’ ‘a small, old house’

 4.1.1 Nouns
 Nouns semantically belong to the class of words whose core members refer to concrete
 objects. Noun also is defined by syntactic criteria. Nouns may function as subject and
 object in a clause and as nominal predicate in equative clauses. They are marked for
 number and case. The case suffixes of nouns play an important role in expressing the
 semantic and syntactic function of noun phrases in Jungar Tuva. There is no
 morphological gender distinction.

 local official documents, prompting some Tuvas to teach themselves how to read it in
 order to seek better jobs or opportunities. However, few Tuvas have any interest in
 mastering written Mongolian, since the language has too little instrumental value in
 society. While Chinese clearly is the most prestigious language, and a required subject
 from the third year of primary school on, few Tuvas make any effort to learn the
 language.

The verb is a morphological complex comprising productive markers of actants, voice,
negation, aspect, mood, tense, person, and number. Only verbs can function as the head
of a VP; other classes require derivational suffixes in order to function as verbs. The
suffixation of a verb is normally in the following order.
 verb stem ± voice ± negation ± aspect ± mood ± tense ± person ± number
5.1.1 Personal markers
The suffixal string of a verb form normally consists of a verbal stem, a thematic suffix
and a personal marker. There are two sets of verb personal markers that are used as verb
inflectional markers. They are o f possessive and pronominal origin. The first is a

In 4 we see the opposite. The idea of the man was already given, and the addition of the

The man and his wife ran around.
Mithun (1995a) suggested that this ‘newsworthy first’ strategy takes advantage of the
heightened pitch and amplitude that are likely to be found at the beginning of an
intonation unit. It does provide a satisying explanation for word order in Seneca and
probably in other Northern Iroquoian languages. Certainly, however, newsworthiness
needs to be more clearly defined.

Of linguistic interest is the fact that Wright recognized the glottal stop, a ubiquitous
Seneca consonant that had been ignored by the Jesuits. He wrote it as an h with a line
across the upper portion: ħ. ‘This sound is very abundant in Seneca,’ he wrote, ‘and, used
in conjunction with certain other modifications, the mode and time of verbs, and various
other circumstances are denoted by it. No one can read or write Seneca intelligibly, who
does not pay the strictest attention to this character, and avoid confounding it with the
rough aspirate of the common h.’

Between 1841 and 1850 the Cattaraugus mission published a periodical titled Ne
Jagó’nigǫ́ëgésgwatha’, or in English ‘The Mental Elevator’, literally ‘it’s used to raise
the mind’ (Figure 1.4). A work titled A Spelling Book in the Seneca Language: with
English Definitions was published in 1842. Wright’s wife Laura, who was also an
accomplished linguist, described it as follows:
 This work is still unfinished. These sheets contain the definitions of several
 hundred Seneca words and a tolerably complete explanation of the grammatical
 principles of the language, except the verb. In respect to the verb no complete
 analysis has yet been effected nor is there much reason to expect the
 accomplishment of this object until some competent Seneca scholar shall have

 13. SYNTAX PART 4
WORD ORDER
Seneca is a language that might be described as exhibiting ‘free word order’, which is to
say that its words are not ordered in a familiar pattern such as subject-verb-object,
subject-object-verb, or the like. In Chapters 10-12 we saw how words and phrases that
amplify the content of a verb quite naturally follow that verb. The manner in which the
ordering of words within phrases is determined by a variant of ‘information flow’ was
described in Chafe (1994c: 156-159). That discussion is summarized here.
While describing a birthday celebration at the Longhouse, the person being celebrated
said
1 Gëdzöhoënö’waënödëno:dë’.
 fish its song they sang it
 They sang fish dance.
The first two words, gëdzöh oënö’, literally ‘fish its song’, are a lexicalized reference to a
familiar Seneca dance. As with lexicalized phrases in general, they occur only in a fixed
order. Of more interest is that fact that the fish dance was mentioned first in the phrase,
the reverse of the English order. From an English point of view it might be thought that 1
shows the order object-verb, but Seneca is an agent-patient language where subjects and
objects do not play a role. One might then hypothesize that 1 shows a patient-verb order,
but that possibility is belied by 2, where the patient comes second.

10.5.4. ne’hoh ‘that or there’. The referent of this very common particle is usually a
topic or a cluster of events or states, rather than a particular person or thing. It may point
to something that was introduced earlier in the discourse (10.5.4.1) or to something
distant in space (10.5.4.2). Sometimes it stands in apposition to a preceding noun
(10.5.4.3).

10.5.4.3. Appositional demonstrative ne’hoh. In an example like the following, which
is rare, ne’hoh may seem to function as a demonstrative adjective, ‘that fish’. But such
cases are probably better interpreted in terms of a noun followed by a demonstrative that
stands in apposition to it, literally ‘the fish, that one’.
Gëdzöh ne’hoh.
fishthat
That fish.
10.6. The particle neh ‘namely’. Seneca pronominal prefixes express the following
types of information regarding the participants in events and states.
 person (first, second, third, inclusive, exclusive)
 gender (masculine, feminine, neuter)
 number (singular, dual, plural)
 role (agent, patient, beneficiary)
A speaker may decide that a hearer needs more information concerning a participant than
the above choices provide. In that case the verb may be followed by the particle neh,
anticipating an amplification to follow. In examples throughout this work it will be seen
that neh is sometimes followed by a comma, sometimes preceded by a comma, or the
comma is absent. The comma represents the boundary of an intonation unit that
verbalizes a single focus of consciousness (e.g., Chafe 1994c). Its placement suggests that
the speaker is already thinking of the amplification (when the comma follows neh), or
thinks of it subsequently (when the comma precedes neh), or thinks of the verb and its
amplification simultaneously (when no comma is present).
10.6.1. Amplification with a noun. In the following example the speaker remembered an
incident from her childhood when she went to visit some relatives and took with her a
teddy bear.
Ho’ka:’ koh neh,nyagwai’,
I took it and namely bear
And I took a (teddy) bear.
The English translation might suggest that neh marks nyagwai’ ‘bear’ as a direct object,
but that would distort its true function. The pronominal prefix in the verb ho’ka:’ ‘I took
it’ included overt reference to a first person agent but the neuter patient had no overt
marking. As explained in 3.4.2, neuter participants are overtly marked only when the
123
 A Grammar of the Seneca Language
verb does not also mark some human participant like the first person referent here. In this
case the nature of the implied neuter patient ‘it’ was amplified with the noun nyagwai’
introduced with neh.
In the next example the amplifying noun is built on the noun root *-öhw- ‘self’ (10.3),
where, as in other examples below, the masculine singular agent prefix ha- repeats the
prefix of the main verb. The speaker had described how this man had gone into the
woods with his daughter, and this sentence made it clear that the one who went hunting
was the man by himself, without the daughter.
Da:h o:nëh nä:hhadówäte’snehhaöhwö’.
so then emphasis he goes hunting namely he himself
So then he went hunting by himself.
The following was spoken at the beginning of a story. The verb wá:hdë:di’ ‘he set out’
introduced a masculine singular agent. The narrator then added neh and the word for
‘man’ as an amplification.
Nónëhjih wá:hdë:di’ neh, hö:gweh.
long.ago he set outnamely a man
Long ago he set out, a man.
The word hö:gweh might seem to have provided little information beyond what was
provided by the masculine singular agent prefix in wá:hdë:di’, which already established
that the person who set out was a single male. But assigning this referent to the hö:gweh
category activated a complex set of associations that included his role in Seneca society,
his relation to his family, and his expected behavior, properties that amplified his status
as more than masculine singular alone.
The inclusion of a masculine singular referent in wá:hdë:di’ did not make this referent
identifiable (or ‘definite’). In order to be identifiable a referent needs prior assignment to
a specific lexical category. The information supplied by a pronominal prefix alone is not
sufficient to create identifiability. The translation ‘a man’ is thus more appropriate than
‘the man’, removing any temptation to regard neh as a definite article.
10.6.2. Amplification with a verb. In the following example the speaker realized that the
hearer would want to know more than just the fact that the visitors were two males, so he
added neh and amplified that information with yadátawak ‘a father and son’, whose
form is that of a stative verb that can be translated literally ‘they are father and son to
each other’ (9.4.1).
Né:ne:’ wa:ya:jö’s neh, yadátawak.
those they (masculine dual) visitednamely a father and son
They visited, a father and his son.
In the next example the speaker was talking about a man who used to walk through the
woods near her house, inspecting the gas pipelines that ran through her property. She said
Ha’de:yö:h nö:h gë:sha:gëh,neh do:dawë:nye:h.
many things I guess repeatedly he sees it namely he is moving about
I guess he kept seeing many things, the one who was moving about.

Cashibo,"The reflexive suffix can only be combined with transitive verbs, which are
derived into intransitive ones by means of this suffix. In this section, I will pay
special attention to the use of empathic/reflexive pronouns as a device to obtain
reflexive constructions in order to complement the information about the reflexive
marker presented in §12.2.2.2. These pronouns are of particular interest for
intransitive predicates, for which they are the only reflexive strategy available.
Emphatic/reflexive pronouns are obtained by means of combining the pronominal
forms ‘ë ‘1sg’, mi ‘2sg’, a ‘3sg’ and nu ‘1pl’ with the adverbial enclitic =bi ‘same, self’.
However, there is evidence to analyse the forms ‘ëbi ‘1sg, emphatic/reflexive’, mibi
‘2sg, emphatic/reflexive’, abi ‘3sg, emphatic/reflexive’ and nubi ‘1pl,
emphatic/reflexive’ as lexicalised elements, not synchronically segmentable. This
evidence comes from the relative position of the enclitic in relation to the case
marker =x. As we have seen in §21.2.1, emphatic/reflexive pronouns follow a
neutral case alignment with the functions of S, A and O equally unmarked.
However, in the S function, this pronominal form can optionally receive the case
marker -x ‘S’. When this happens, the adverbial enclitic appears before the case
 699
maker and this is unexpected for adverbial enclitics (see §6.2.1). This fact strongly
suggests that emphatic/reflexive pronouns have lexicalised. In accordance with this,
Valenzuela (2003: 188-191) reports for Shipibo-Konibo that these emphatic pronouns
can be modified (again) by the enclitic =bi producing forms like ebi-x=bi ‘1sg.EMP-
S=self’, but so far I have not found equivalent examples in Kashibo-Kakataibo. See
the following example, and notice that the case marker is optional:
(975) ‘ëbix kana banain
‘ëbi=xkana bana-i-n
1sg.EMP=S NAR.1sgspeak-IMPF-1/2p
‘I speak to myself.’
In the following example we find the adverbial enclitic =bi after the case
marker -x (i.e. in its expected position) and therefore the different morphological
elements can be segmented out. As we can see from the glosses, in this second case, a
reflexive reading is not possible and this fact shows that the structures in (975) and
(976) are different:
(976) ‘ë-xbi kana banain
‘ë=x=bikana bana-i-n
1sg=S=same NAR.1sgspeak-IMPF-1/2p
 ‘I myself speak (to somebody else)’
*‘I speak to myself.’
In the following examples, I present a small set of sentences in order to show
the different emphatic/reflexive pronouns in use. Note that in combination with a
verb like kwan- ‘to go’, these pronominal forms express high levels of volition and
responsibility of the subject (recall that the case-marker is optional in all instances):
(977) ‘ëbix kana kwanin
‘ëbi=xkana kwan-i-n
1sg.EMP=S NAR.1sggo-IMPF-1/2p
‘I am going because I want to.’

(980) nubi=xkananunakwan-i-n
nubi=xkananunakwan-i-n
1pl.EMP=S NAR.1pl go-IMPF-1/2p
‘We are going because we want to.’
As show in the following examples, emphatic/reflexive pronouns can also be
used in combination with the reflexive marker on a transitive verb. Differently from
what we have seen above, in this type of reflexive construction, the use of the
emphatic/reflexive pronoun is not obligatory:
(981) ‘ëx kanaisakatin
‘ë=xkanais-akat-i-n
1sg =SNAR.1sg see-REF-IMPF-1/2p
‘ëbix kanaisakatin
‘ëbi=xkanais-akat-i-n
1sg.EMP=S NAR.1sg see-REF-IMPF-1/2p
‘I look at myself.’
In the case of reflexive constructions derived from transitive verbs, the
emphatic/reflexive pronoun can also occur as a reflexive object (see example in
(982)). This is also possible for a few intransitive verbs, like bana- ‘to speak’ (see
example in (983)). It is not possible in either case to have an emphatic/reflexive
pronoun twice in the clause:
 701
(982) ‘ëx kana‘ëbiisakatin
‘ë=xkana‘ëbiis-akat-i-n
1sg =SNAR.1sg 1sg.REF see-REF-IMPF-1/2p
‘I look at myself.’
*‘ëbix kana‘ëbiisakatin

*‘ëbixkana ‘ëbi bana-i-n
‘ëbi=xkana ‘ëbi bana-i-n
1sg.EMP=S NAR.1sg1sg.REFspeak-IMPF-1/2p
Ditransitive predicates can also be derived into reflexive predicates. As we
have seen in §21.3.8, this type of predicate uses two different reflexive strategies
depending on the object that is co-referential with the subject. If the theme-like object
is co-referential with the subject, only the reflexive marker is required. If the
recipient-like object is co-referential with the subject, in addition to the reflexive
marker, an emphatic/reflexive pronoun is required and an NP referring to the patient
can also appear. This NP surfaces unmarked and is similar to a grammatical object.

Conversely, the markers =bë ‘comitative (S)’ and =bëtan ‘comitative (A)’
prototypically express that the event is carried out by both the subject of the predicate
and the comitative object to more or less the same degree. This can be seen if we
compare the meaning of examples (952) and (953), and examples (955) and (954)).
Notice that the semantic difference is more transparent in the latter case.

Thus, it seems to be the case that -kin ‘associative applicative’ and =bëtan
‘comitative’ are not completely equivalent in terms of their semantics. The latter
always presents the event as being developed equally by the two participants (the
subject and the comitative adjunct); while the former always implies that one of the
participant (the subject or the applicative object) is responsible for the event and has a
more prominent role (a similar asymmetry has been documented for Shipibo-
Konibo, by Valenzuela 2010b). The subject can be interpreted as a helper (and
therefore the event is assumed to be the responsibility of the object) or the subject can
be interpreted as triggering the event. In this latter case, the semantics of the
construction is equivalent to what Shibatani and Pardeshi (2002) call associative
causation.
21.4.1.3 -anan ‘malefactive’
Differently from the other two suffixes discussed in this section, the form -anan
(~ -naan) ‘malefactive’ appeared only twice in my whole text database. However, I
have heard this form in conversations and I have been able to elicit several sentences
in order to better understand its syntactic nature. Notice that, despite their identical
phonological form, -anan ‘malefactive’ and -anan ‘reciprocal’ (see §21.4.4.2) are not
to be analysed as the same suffix. They do not only have different semantics, but also
different morphophonemics: only -anan ‘malefactive’ shows the alternative
form -naan.

18.3.4.2 -mainun ‘different subjects/objects, simultaneous event (durative)’
The forms -këbë(tan) and -mainun are both used for simultaneous events that do not
share either subjects or objects. The difference is that while -këbë(tan) can be
translated as ‘when’ (with the corresponding verb being presented as a punctual
event), -mainun can be translated as ‘while’ (with the corresponding verb being
presented as a durative event). One example of this form, which is also found in the
coordinator ‘imainun ‘and’ (see §9.5.1), follows:

18.3.4.3 -an ‘different subjects/objects, previous event’
The suffix -an ‘different subjects/objects, previous event’ is used when the switch-
reference clause refers to a previous event and the two clauses in the chain do not
share their subjects and objects. In the following example, it appears on the verb tsót-
‘to sit down’, which is the first constituent of the sentence, modifying the main verb
buan- ‘to bring’. Note that there is another predicate in the construction, chuminbut-
këbë=bi ‘to become thin-different subjects/objects, simultaneous event,
intransitive=same’, that occupies a clause-internal position and functions as a
converb:

18.3.4.4 -nun ‘different subjects, posterior event’
The suffix -nun ‘different subjects, posterior event’ is used to indicate that two clauses
in a chain do not share the subject (S/A) and that the dependent clause expresses a
590
posterior event. However, differently from the other suffixes presented in this section,
-nun can be used to express an argument tracking pattern according to which (1) the
object of one of the clauses is the subject of the other; or (2) the two clauses share
their object. Therefore, -nun codes ‘different subjects’ and not different
subjects/objects’. The semantic difference found between this suffix and the other
ones in this section may be related to the fact that there is no means to express this
argument tracking pattern for posterior dependent events otherwise. Thus, while we
find specialised forms for object to object, subject to object and object to subject
argument-tracking in the case of simultaneous and previous events, this is not true in
the case of posterior events. In this context, -nun has a wider semantic range than the
corresponding forms for other temporal relations in the paradigm. Three examples
illustrating the different types of argument tracking that can be expressed by -nun
follow (notice that, as other forms marking posterior events, -nun usually receives a
purpositive interpretation):

18.4 Marking indirect participation in switch-reference predicates
One interesting fact associated with switch-reference clauses is that they offer the
possibility to indicate the indirect participation of the subject of the main clause in
the dependent event. In other words, if we have a switch-reference clause and a main
clause with different subjects/objects, but the subject of the latter clause is indirectly
compromised or emotionally affected by the event presented in the former, Kashibo-
Kakataibo has a specialised construction to express that semantic relation. In this
case, the different subject/object marker is replaced by the marker -ia ‘S/A/O>O,
simultaneous event’ and it is followed by the ‘factitive’ marker -o (also used to obtain
transitive predicates from adjectives and nouns, see Chapter 7), which in turn carries
a ‘same subject’ marker. In this construction, -o is clearly not prosodically attached to
the preceding switch-reference predicate and functions as an independent verb. Let
us compare the two following examples:
(778) unipakëkëbë kaisa xanukwankëshín
 uni pakët-këbë kaisa xanukwan-akë-x-ín
 man.ABS fall.down-DS/A/O(SE.INTR) NAR.REP.3p woman.ABS go-REM.PAST-3p-prox
 ‘It is said that, when the man fell down, the woman went’
(779) uni pakëtiaoi kaisa xanu
 unipakët-ia o-ikaisa xanu
 man.ABS fall.down-S/A/O>O(SE) FACT-S/A>S(SE) NAR.REP.3p woman.ABS
592
 kwankëshín
 kwan-akë-x-ín
 go-REM.PAST-3p-prox
 ‘It is said that, when the man fell down, the woman went (but she saw him or was in
 some way interested in or compromised with the event, because he was her husband,
 her enemy or something like this).’
 In the example in (778), the switch-reference clause presents the two events as
being in a temporal relationship (the woman went when the man fell down). By
contrast, in (779), an additional indirect relationship between the subject of the main
clause and the event presented in the switch-reference clause is indicated. Even
though the introduction of the form -o ‘factitive’ plus a same subject marker suggests
that, grammatically, the two clauses share their subjects, semantically this is not true.
The construction only attributes an indirect participation in the dependent event to
the subject of the main clause. In general, the subject of the main clause tends to be
interpreted (1) as a perceiver and/or (2) as someone emotionally concerned with the
event.
",,SOV,,,0,0,
Cashibo,"22.2The discourse basis of constituent order
Based on isolated sentences out of context and with all their arguments overtly
expressed, one could say that AOV and SV are the least marked constituent orders of
Kashibo-Kakataibo sentences. A/S arguments are followed by the obligatory second
position enclitics, and the O arguments (in transitive and ditransitive clauses) or any
kind of adjunct appear between these enclitics and the verb. Thus, the following
template could be used to describe constituent order in Kashibo-Kakataibo:
(993) A/S – second position enclitics – O/adjuncts – verb
This is exemplified with the following elicited sentences:
(994) ‘ën kanaMaria ‘atsa‘inanin
‘ë=nkanaMaria ‘atsa‘inan-i-n
1sg=A NAR.1sg Maria.ABS manioc.ABS give-IMPF-1/2p
A ENCLRec-O The-OV
‘I give manioc to Maria.’
(995) ‘ëx kanaLimanuJuanbë kwanin
‘ë-xkanaLima=nu Juan-bëkwan-i-n
1sg=S NAR.1sg Lima=LOC Juan-COM(S) go-IMPF-1/2p
S ENCLOBL OBLV
‘I will go to Lima with Juan.’
 709
The first interesting point to note is that the position of the different types of
adjuncts and complements is not fixed in relation to each other, and many different
orders are attested and common in Kashibo-Kakataibo, even in elicited and context-
free clauses. Thus, any proposal that Kashibo-Kakataibo has fixed constituent order
has to include the qualification that this is not true for any constituent occuring
between the two main landmarks of the sentence, i.e. between the second position
enclitics and the verb.

 Word order as determined by information structure (Le. topic / comment,
 old/new information etc.) does not condition the coding of the subject'S

 does interact with feature coding; cf. 2. 1.3.6.3.3.

Turkish,"Order of the constituents in combinations of arguments
When arguments are combined in adjective phrases, the ablative
argument is last in an unmarked word order; however, given the general

usual discourse and pragmatic conditions on marked word orders.

Turkish,"Order of the constituents
Just as in copular sentences with predicate nominals, the constituent
order for copular sentences with predicate adjectives is exactly the same
as that seen in ""regular"" sentences with verbal predicates. Since Turkish
is an SOV-language (with 'V' to be understood more generally as
""predicate"" and 'a' more generally as any kind of object as well as
adjunct), the order will be subject-adjuncts / objects-predicate
adjective+copula+infiection markers.

generally as any kind of object as well as adjuncts), the order will be
subject-adjuncts/ objects-predicate nominal+copula+inflection markers.

Turkish,"Order of constituents
The unmarked order for the combination of verb, subject, and direct
object is SOY, i.e. subject-direct object-verb. However, Turkish is a so-
called free word order language; therefore, this order can change in a
rather unrestricted fashion, depending on considerations of focus (the
position to the immediate left of the verb), topic (sentence-initial
position), and presupposition (positions following the verb).
As for the other constituents mentioned in subsection 1. 2. 1. 2. 4. , it is
less clear that there is any unmarked order. Overall, the subject must
precede all other arguments in an unmarked order, and the verb mus.t be
final. Native speakers tend to agree that locational arguments precede
other objects; there also seems to be a (less strong) tendency to prefer the
order direct object-indirect object-verb to the order indirect object-direct
object-verb, when the order is unmarked. Otherwise, no strong
tendencies for unmarked orders can be formulated.
1. 2. 1. 3.",,SOV,,,0,0,
Turkish," Despite variation in the order of the subject and the objects, Turkish obeys
Greenberg‟s Universal 1, that subjects almost always precede the object – this is the
predominant pattern in Turkish. However, it has a strong tendency toward violating the
principle that the verb and the object are generally adjacent (Whaley, p. 84),
particularly when locative phrases are used:
(60)adam kitab-ɨmasa-nɨn yst-yn-ɛ koj-du
man book-OBJtable-POSSRtop-POSSD-TO put-PAST
„the man put the book on the table‟
5.3 Word-Order Variation
 Variation in word-order is the greatest in the VP. As already seen from the
examples, and as illustrated specifically in (96), the direct and indirect objects can be
easily switched, usually forcing marking on the direct object.

„the table that you put the dirty dishes on'
Finally, DPs consist simply of a determiner (D).
5.2 Word-Order Typology
The most common word orders for language are SVO and SOV, and Turkish is
primarily an SOV language. SOV languages tend to be head-final, and Turkish, as we
have seen, generally follows this model, as evidenced by the fact that the object
precedes the verb in every sentence we have. In fact, Turkish serves as an excellent
example of a head-final language. In each PSR, the head of the phrase comes last; the
morphology for every syntactic category also comes at the end of the word. In verb-
final languages the possessor almost always precedes the possessed, as is the case
with Turkish. Verb-final languages also tend towards postpositions (which in Turkish
have become realized as locative case marking), and a pattern of modifiers preceding
the element modified. Turkish follows this latter pattern fairly consistently, certain
relative and complementizing constructions being the notable exceptions.
",,SOV,,,0,0,
Turkish,"All that aside, relative clauses do look remarkably like regular Turkish sentences,
consisting of a subject, object, indirect object, and verb (with various parts being
optional or part of the main clause). They also follow standard SOV word order as
much as possible (variation being due to the fact that one or another part of the
sentence must fulfill its position in the main clause). The objects of the relative clause
also take standard object case marking, as in (237). This all suggests that relative
clauses may best be represented in the PSRs as simply S, and it is a matter of
morphology that relativized sentences take special possessive morphemes. An
alternative analysis would be to say that the relativized sentence is primarily nominal,
and to subsume it under the recursive NP.

 There are other instances of variation in word order as well, such as VPs split by the
subject NP as we will see later on, and particular freedom to move the object NPs. This
is likely due to the fact that case marking tends to make word order freer (Whaley, p.
81).

§1. Language Profile
Turkish is a Turkic language (in the Altaic branch) spoken by some 50 million
people, the majority of which live in Turkey, where it is the official national language. It
is related to some Chinese and Russian languages. The language is divided into
eastern and western dialects (the western portion being composed of a single dialect,
Danubian). There are 36 total languages existent in Turkey, and of these two are
extinct. This total also includes two different versions of Arabic, and Farsi. Turkey itself
is divided into Europe and Asia, with 24 and 12 languages respectively.1 Many of the
other Turkic languages in the area form „chains‟ of dialects, with nearby languages
being extremely similar (and sometimes even mutually intelligible), and more distant
ones being decidedly distinct. This continuum of language makes it difficult to define
clear language boundaries (Kornfilt, 1987, pp. 619-620). Turkey also includes a
number of refugees from Central Asia, numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

Parmi les fonctions du syntagme postpositionnel figurent celles d‟argument (objet

requis par le verbe, tandis que l‟adjoint non. D‟un autre côté, la différence formelle consiste
en ce que la postposition qui est la tête du syntagme ayant la fonction d‟argument (t
„accusatif‟) n‟apparaît que dans ce contexte. Autrement dit, la postposition accusative
établit exclusivement un objet oblique, tandis que, du côté des adjoints, une même

grammatical functions - Pu and T can be conflated to one function, which I will call
secondary object. However, Pi and R cannot be grouped into the one function of
primary object, because of their different positions in the clause. I will refer to the
suffix on the verb as the object slot even though it seems more closely related to
individuation/animacy than to a grammatical function, but I will continue to make a

Comparison of the relative constituent orders of the core nominals of transitive and
intransitive clauses suggests that Chukchi constituent order is not sensitive to the
syntactic role of ‘subject’ (defined as a clustering of S and A); in fact, if there is any
syntactic unit unifying the constituent order of core arguments it is a cluster of S
and O. Overt A nominals are a statistically minor phenomenon. It should be noted
that S and O are both marked by the absolutive case, and that absolutive case
nominals seem to have the same discourse functions irrespective of their syntactic
role (§6.3.1, §9).
The statistics in figure 5.1 include examples of quoted speech, which is atypical in
that there is a much stronger tendency to overtly specify all arguments (the

Sentence types
5.1Introduction
This chapter is intended as a brief introduction to the different types of clause and
sentence found in Chukchi texts. Chukchi is a morphologically rich, non-
configurational language, and at first glance Chukchi syntax offers a barren
prospect to the linguist. Scholars of Chukchi have typically neglected it in favour of
the fertile fields of morphology. Syntactic investigations have been situated more
with respect to function equivalence to syntactic operations in other languages,
which in the case of Chukchi inevitably brings in a large amount of morphology as
well. Skorik’s monograph, Aspects of Chukchi syntax (Skorik 1948), deals almost
exclusively with the mixed morphological and syntactic phenomenon of
incorporation. However, Chukchi is of course subject to levels of organisation larger
than the word. While constituent order is relatively unconstrained, it is still not the
case that any constituent order is possible—some constraints do exist and these
constraints are amenable to structural description. There has hitherto been little
published on the Chukchi syntax-pragmatics interface (§19).
The first part of this chapter discusses clauses. Clauses are a syntactic construct
consisting of a highly grammatically integrated nucleus and a loosely
grammatically integrated periphery. The prototypical clause is the BASIC VERBAL
CLAUSE (§5.2). Clauses may differ from this prototype in a number of parameters.
Sections §§5.3-5 deal with the other structural types of clauses observed in the
Chukchi texts. Section §5.6 summarises how these structural types correspond to
discourse functions; imparting information (indicative modality), seeking
information (interrogative), eliciting an action or behaviour (imperative), or
speaking as a pretended other (quoted speech).
The main syntactic unit used in this description is the SENTENCE. For the purposes
of this grammatical description, the sentence is defined as coextensive with the
PROSODIC PHRASE, a characteristic intonation contour encompassing a certain
amount of syntactically and pragmatically related linguistic material including one
or more clauses. As a level of analysis it has the advantage that it is explicitly
marked in the phonological form of the utterance, and so avoids the risk of

 [Then they moved camp], finally the bitch made a big house.[ke149]
In spontaneous texts it is highly unusual for both A and O to have overt nominal
specification, and it is quite usual for neither to be present. All constituent orders
are attested: V, AV, VA, OV, VO, AOV, OAV, AVO, OVA, VAO, VOA (the latter
two are very rare, and are not attested in the data used for figure 5.1 below).
Discontinuities only involve O, which is the nominal in the absolutive case and
which can be specified by a noun phrase rather than by a single word.
Figure 5.1 shows the relative frequencies of the different constituent
order/anaphora combinations for 223 transitive and 217 intransitive verbal clauses
from narrative corpus. Note that the verb without any overt nominal arguments is
most common, and that next most common is the verb preceded by O or S, then the
verb followed by O or S. Combinations involving an overt nominal A are much less
common.

element already established in the discourse in such a way that it is retrievable
without overt nominal specification; the presence of the topical argument is evident
from the bound pronominals of the verbal cross-reference.
A ‘new topic’ is something of a contradiction in terms; a ‘new topic’ is really a
focussed noun which will become a topic. New topics occur sentence-initially, along
with other ‘information-heavy’ focal elements.
The following polar question establishes a new topic nenen? baby/s in the
sentence initial position:
004a nenen?=·m?r-in?tl·a- reenn-?-twa-qen?
 baby.3sgABS=EMPH 3pl-POSS.3sgABS mother-LOCwith.PP HAB-E-be-3sg
 INTERVIEWER — Does the baby remain with their mother? [aa2.26]
It is not in fact possible to answer this particular question with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’
(the speaker shows himself willing to use single yes/no answers in other sections of
the text), and so instead it invokes a certain amount of explanation. This has two
contrasting parts; (i) ?tl·a reen n?twaqen it’s [they’re] with the mother and (ii)
·enqu ninetc?qinet she rejects them. The argument nenen? the baby/s is now
the topic, and so is only ever indicated by verb agreement (S of n?twaqen and O of
ninetc?qinet and nenalerk?pcew?qen):
004b ?tl·a-reenn-?-twa-qen?nneniikew?r jawrena=·m

 reject-VBaseHAB-TR-AUX-E-3plreally HAB-TR-INTS-beat-E-3sg
 INTERVIEWEE — They remain with their mother one year, then after one year
 she rejects them, she beats them up ... [aa2.27]
The orienting elements ew?r jawrena then next year occur in between the two
clauses, iconically marking the juncture of the two different time periods being
discussed (see §19.2.4).
Note that topicality is a pragmatic category which applies to arguments, whereas
focus can apply to any element. Narratives are generally about a relatively small
and stable set of referents (e.g. people) in a series of actions and events. While an
event can recur with a series of different arguments/referents, this is pragmatically
marked. An event construed without any of its arguments is highly abstract, and is
not the sort of thing that people typically talk about. Thus ‘aboutness’, and hence
topicality, is more naturally a property of a nominal argument/referent, not a verb.
This does not apply to focus—new important information is as happily an action or
event as it is a referential entity.
19.2 Pragmatic word order
Chukchi is typologically a pragmatic word order language. Words are ranked so
that the focussed (or newsworthy) element comes first. An element may be focussed
Chapter 19PRAGMATICS OF SENTENCE FORM345.
due to a variety of pragmatic factors: it may represent significant new information,
introduce a new topic, or it may be contrasted with something else.
It probably doesn’t make descriptive sense to claim that Chukchi has some kind of
basic, syntactically defined word order (i.e. a word order typology as discussed by
Greenberg 1963 and many others). As shown in figure 5.1 of §5.2, Chukchi does
have a statistical preference for certain word orders; however, a much stronger
conclusion which can be made from a statistical investigation of relative placement
of verbs and nominal arguments is that overt nominal arguments of verbs are in
fact slightly dispreferred, and that verb agreement affixial pronominals are
frequently the only exponents of an argument. Single overt arguments occur only
slightly less frequently, but it is particularly unusual to have two overt nominal
arguments in a clause—this happens so rarely that it is impossible to make any
statistical claims about preferred order. The frequent use of pronominals bound to
the verb in preference to free pronominals is typologically common in pragmatic
word-ordering languages. Mithun (1992) discusses a genetically divergent selection
of such languages and finds this feature to be the norm:
A crucial feature of purely pragmatically ordering languages may be the
nature of the grammatical relationships between the verb and
associated constituents. In languages like Cayuga, Ngandi, and Coos,
the pronouns bear the primary case relations to the verb. The
associated noun phrases function grammatically more as appositives to
the pronominal affixes, rather than directly as verbal arguments
themselves.",,No dominant order,,,0,0,
Chukchi,"NOMINALS Chapter 9
Constituents of a nominal phrase are ordered such that the most grammatical
nominals are furthermost from the head and the most lexical are closest. There is
however no preferred left-to-right ordering; demonstratives are always at one
extreme or another of a NP, with other pronominals next furthermost out, and
adjectives, numerals and modifier nominals situated closest to the head. Thus, the
linear ordering within the NP is related to a grammaticality cline whereby the
most grammatical elements are furthermost from and least grammatical (most
lexical) elements are closest to the lexical head. This is illustrated schematically in
figure 9.1 (to avoid giving preference to left→right or right→left word order, the
diagram is drawn with the NP core at the bottom and the periphery at the top).
The rationale for demonstratives being considered more grammatical than other
pronouns is that the selection of a demonstrative does not rely on any intrinsic
properties of its referent, unlike the selection of other pronouns which, for a given
referent, are not shifters. Any particular referent is intrinsically singular or plural,
intrinsically animate or inanimate, etc. The selection of quantifier pronoun is
determined by the number of the referent and selection of the
indefinite/interrogative pronoun by its animacy. Possessive/relational pronouns are
unique identifiers according to other semantic parameters (§8.7) such as possessor,
source, material, use, which are also not shifters in the sense used here.

 LE VERBE
Le verbe, avec ses participes et ses nombreux gérondifs qui
peuvent faire fonction de prédicats dans des propositions
dépendantes et indépendantes, avec ses auxiliaires qui donnent
naissance à des locutions verbales, avec sa facilité à incorporer
son sujet et ses compléments ou à s’intégrer lui-même à
d’autres radicaux, joue un rôle prépondérant dans la phrase.
Le verbe transitif possède une construction ergative, le verbe
intransitif une construction nominative. Certains verbes peuvent
être tantôt intransitifs, tantôt transitifs, comme ивык dire.
Intransitifs, ils ont un sujet à l’absolutif ; transitifs, ils ont un sujet
(un actant) à l’ergatif et un objet (un patient) à l’absolutif. Les
verbes intransitifs recréés à partir de verbes transitifs se
fléchissent comme les autres verbes intransitifs.

Mara," A question of terminology is first addressed; researchers have
used differing nomenclature for pronominal words in Tibeto-Burman
languages. The structure of intransitive sentences is then presented,
together with the set of personal pronouns and subject pronominal
words. A set of intransitive examples illustrates both required and
optional pronouns and pronominal words. Transitive sentences are
then discussed, both examples and structure, with the focus being on
the effect of combinations of agent and object pronominal words. The
pronominal words themselves are then examined in more detail. A
morphemic analysis of these words compares Weidert’s (1985) IPA
transcriptions and associated semantics to those detailed in this
101
study. Pronominal word syntax is then examined for its relevance to a
case marking pattern influenced by word order. The section
concludes by proposing a deictic hierarchy of these pronominal words
based on their order and placement relative to the verb.

 In both intransitive and transitive structures, subject, agent, and
object pronouns are often omitted in speech, pronominal words and
word order providing the necessary semantics. By contrast,
pronominal words are essential with the exception of the 3p object
pronominal word, absent in most cases (See (59), (65), (70), and (75)
for examples of the absent3p object pronominal marker.)
 The nominative particle “ta” may be omitted; nonetheless, if this
particle is present, a subject or subject pronoun must be explicit.

Mara,"3.4. Morphosyntax
While Lorrain and Savidge remain the most comprehensive
morphosyntactic sources of information on Mara, more recent work has
built upon their grammatical foundation. Dryer (2008a) reviews word
order patterns in Tibeto-Burman VO (verb-object) and OV (object-verb)
languages, examining the word order features of noun-adjective, relative
clause and noun, noun-demonstrative, numeral-noun, degree and
adjective, and negative and verb. Mara is among the languages he
examines; an interesting finding is that Mara is uncommon in splitting its
demonstratives in a DemNDem structure (Dryer, 2008a:42), as does the
 15
Central Chin language Mizo (Lushei), perhaps supporting an argument for
their common grouping. Dryer does not discuss the morphosyntactic
structures reviewed here, but he does provide a valuable syntactic
taxonomy of pronominal affixes (Dryer, 2008b), which informs the
terminology used in this study when discussing the Mara pronominal
system. Although Dryer (2008a) is among the more recent of the
references cited in this study, he still depends upon Lorrain (1951) and
Savidge (1908) as his primary data sources for Mara word order features.

Mara," Thus, in Table 6
and Figure 5, the derived transcription selected is that which follows
directly from Lorrain’s textual description.
8 Although “keima” can be used as a subject pronoun, it is more
commonly used as an object pronoun. No rationale was found for the
variation in the 2sg or 3sg personal pronoun forms.
9
 The interlinguistic commonalities and differences for cutting and
breaking events are known to be significant; (Majid et al, 2008)
defines four semantic dimensions accounting for variance among
144
languages. Mara’s semantic distinctions for food cutting, in
particular, do not appear to correlate well to the dimensions proposed
by Majid et al.; further exploration of cutting events in Mara would be
an interesting area of study.

the scope of this study.

Tables 25 and 26 show that the syntactic order of pronominal
words cannot be ascertained merely by case; nominative forms can

both precede and follow accusative forms as in (93) and (94), and in

 Weidert defines a notion of “morphosyntactic unpredictability,”
which seeks to measure the degree of regularity of morphosyntactic
structures such as word order within a given language (Weidert,
1985:905). His unpredictability measurement depends upon the
“pattern congruity exhibited by orderly arrangements of agglutinated
morph sequences” (Weidert, 1985:909); his assessment of pattern
congruity is specifically based upon the evaluation of the consistency
 127
of pronominal word composition and their order relative to the verb
and other participants. In the study of four Sino-Tibetan languages:
Kham, Lohorong Rai, Nocte, and Mara (Lakher), Mara ranks highest in
morphosyntactic unpredictability with an unpredictability
measurement twice that of its nearest neighbor, Lohorong Rai.
7.5.2. Transitive sentence structure
 As Section 7.2 revealed, intransitive structures show SV
(subject-verb) word order, both when optional pronouns are included
and when they are omitted. If a subject pronoun is included, it
precedes the subject pronominal word, which precedes the verb. If
the subject pronoun is omitted, then the subject pronominal word
alone fulfills its role. Example (96) reviews this intransitive structure,
where “S” indicates “subject” and “V” indicates “verb.” Red elements are
required; parenthesized elements such as (Keimo) or (S) are optional;
 128
96)we laugh
(Keimo) eima pahnie
1pl.pronoun 1pl.subj.pwlaugh
(S)S V
 When optional agent and object pronouns are included in
transitive sentence structures, Mara employs an AOV (agent-object-
verb) word order. Regardless of the order of the pronominal words or
their relation to the verb, the agent pronoun will precede the object
pronoun relative to the verb, as shown in (97). “A,” and “O” indicate
“agent,” and “object.” Parenthesized elements such as (O) and (keima)
are optional.
97)You (sg) thank me
(na ta) (keima)einalychi
2sg.pronnom.part1ps.obj.pro 1sg.obj.pw thank 2sg.agent.pw
A (O) O V
 However, when pronominal words are used as the sole means to
indicate sentence participants, Mara embraces no fewer than five
different transitive sentence structures, seen below in (98-102). For
simplicity, optional elements are omitted. Required elements are
 129
shown in red, and elements that may be semantically necessary are
shown in blue.
I. All sentences with 2sg or 2pl as the object have AOV pronominal
word order. This structure may also be used when the A is 2pl and
the O is 3pl. See (98).

Table 27 summarizes the distribution of these structures. Where the
A takes the same syntactic position as the S in an intransitive sentence
structure, Mara exhibits properties of a nominative-accusative system,
where A and S are marked alike. This nominative-accusative structure
holds when the O is in the 2p and 3p. However, Mara exhibits
properties of an ergative-absolutive system when the O is in the 1p.
The O is in the same syntactic position as the S of an intransitive
sentence: O and S are marked alike and A is marked differently. Mara
could thus be described as a split ergative language, using both
nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems.

The pronoun in Yuchi is always prefixed to the stem, both in
the nominal and in the verbal complex. Within the group of per-

 The sentence structure is comparatively simple and very regular.
The simple sentence consists of a subject noun (which may be
modified by attributes, classifying suffixes etc.), an object noun,
and the predicative verbal complex in which the subject and object
are always repeated in the forms of the personal pronouns. Thus the
sentence: ""the man saw the horse"" is rendered in Yuchi: gonfe'nq
b^axTe'wdng we'hgTue Man the-
—horse the — it he saw. If there
are several verbal ideas they are expressed by juxtaposition of
verbal complexes (e. g. p. 92, 31: How to get home she did not

 fairly constant. Changes in word order generally create a change in focus and or

Subordinations

et nominalisations
Dans la grammaire traditionnelle, on appelle proposition subordonnée une structure
syntaxique qui a la même forme qu'une phrase (en particulier: elle comporte un
verbe) mais qui remplit le rôle d'un complément dans une structure supérieure.
Ainsi les propositions dites compléti1!es sont sujet ou (plus fréquemment) objet de
verbe (par ex., [Qu'il ait dit cela) m ëtonne ; Je pense [qu'il a raison)), les propositions
dites circonstancielles sont comme les adverbes des compléments circonstanciels
(Il estparti [avant quej'arrive); [Si tu veux} je t'expliquerai; Je te dis cela [pour que
tu saches}...) et les propositions dites relatives sont des compléments de nom (L'enfant
[qui est là-bas) est mon fils; Le livre [que je lis} est sans intérêt). Les mots qui intro-
duisent les subordonnées sont des conjonctions (dans le cas des complétives et des
circonstancielles) ou des pronoms relatif (dans le cas des relatives).
En palikur, il existe des propositions subordonnées qui correspondent à celles du
français, mais certairies subordonnées du français se traduisent par des noms
dérivés de verbes.

un peu plus complexe: le sujet est un groupe nominal composé d'un démonstratif
et d'un nom; et le verbe est suivi d'un complément {d'objet} qui a lui aussi la
forme d'un groupe nominal composé d'un numéral (on verra plus loin que ce
n'est pas un « article indéfini ») et d'un nom. Donc la syntaxe de ces phrases est
très similaire dans les deux langues. La principale différence est que dans (1) on
trouve en français un article défini, alors qu'il n'yen a pas en palikur.
Essayons de généraliser. On dira que dans toutes ces' phrases il y a deux grandes
parties, un sujet et un prédicat. Chacune de ces deux parties peut être très simple,
c'est-à-dire être réduite à un seul mot, comme dans (1) et (2), ou complexe,
voire très complexe: dans la phrase (3), le sujet est un groupe nominal de deux
mots, et le prédicat est un groupe verbal de trois mots, composé d'un verbe et
d'un groupe nominal de deux mots.
Généralisons encore: un groupe nominal et un grbupe verbal peuvent être com-
posés de plusieurs mots, et s'il n'y a qu'un nom ou un verbe, on dira qu'il s'agit
quand même d'un groupe nominal ou d'un groupe verbal: mais que ces groupes
ont la forme la plus simple possible, respectivement un nom ou un verbe.
En palikur, le sujet est toujours nominal, autrement dit il a la forme d'un groupe
nominal (simple ou complexe), comme dans (1) et (3), ou encore d'un pronom,
comme dans (2). Le prédicat, lui, peut prendre une forme plus variée: il peut
être un groupe verbal comme dans les trois phrases ci-dessus, mais aussi autre
chose qu'un groupe verbal, comme nous allons le voir.

 Nevertheless, a few pertinent remarks may be made on Mutsun
phonetic laws. The language is phonetically smooth and simple,
the average word being an orderly alternation of consonant and
vowel. Either consonant or vowel may begin or end a word, but
consonantal combinations seem to be missing initially or finally,
the few recorded cases being probably due to error. Medially
certain combinations are permitted, though it is not easy to de-
termine these. Thus, latak-na, ""go for geese,"" becomes by meta-
thesis lalkana. Similarly, certain suffixes are varied in order to
avoid unwieldly and harsh complexes, as kai-s, but men-se (in-
terrogative) ; uta-kma, but inis-mak (plural). There appears also
to be a feeling for vocalic harmony, and some suffixes are varied
to the end that their vowel may correspond and harmonize with
the characteristic or stem vowel of the word. Thus sumi-ri-ni,
but towo-ro-ste; xana-ksa, but tare-kse. Again certain vowels
seem to be dominants and survive in assimilation or elision. Thus
the past tense suffixes -is and -in are dominant and -kne-is be-
comes -knis; -pu-in, -pin. A thorough phonetic study of the lan-
guage would doubtless codify all these rules and elucidate many
others.

 INTRODUCTION
 A century ago Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta, one of the
most earnest and indefatigable members of the order of St.
Francis, collected a mass of 2884 words, phrases, and sentences
from the language of the Mutsun Indians, spoken at his mission
of San Juan Bautista near Monterey, California. At about the
same time he composed a grammar of the language, which is one
of the branches of the Costanoan linguistic group. These two
manuscripts were sent by Alexander S. Taylor to the Smithsonian
Institute, which loaned them for publication to John G. Shea, in
whose Library of American Linguistics they appear as volumes
iv and viii, 1861 and 1862. Together they form one of the fullest
and most complete collections of data extant on a Pacific Coast
language. There is little doubt that the missionary knew the
language well and interpreted its psychology and spirit fairly
correctly. In his grammar there appears less strict adherence to
the form and structure of Latin grammar, less subconscious
premise of Latin as the standard par excellence than is generally
found in grammars of this time and type. Nevertheless, in spite
of the comparative excellence of the grammar, but because of its
lack of scientific arrangement, unphonetic orthography, and the
foreign tongue, it is deemed better to rearrange and formulate
the grammar, using as a basis the phrases of the vocabulary.

1.3.1 Previous work
Aside from a few wordlists (Izaquirre 1927: 1775 words, Carrasco 1901: 170 words),
the first major linguistic work on Yine was done by the SIL missionary linguist Esther
Matteson, who worked with the Yine beginning in the late 1940’s, and in 1965 pub-
lished her PhD dissertation, a grammar (cast in the tagmemics framework) and small
 9
dictionary (Matteson 1965). This grammar is the data source for most subsequent
work on the Yine language, including the phonological studies in Lin (1987, 1992,
1997) and Parker (1989) and for typological surveys of Amazonian and Arawak(an)
languages.5 . In addition to the grammar, Matteson also produced several other lin-
guistic and anthropological studies, including a grammar sketch in Matteson (1951),
papers on Yine phonology and morphology (Matteson 1954; Matteson and Pike 1958),
and an analyzed text (Matteson 1955),
The second major primary work on Yine is the Diccionario Piro (Wise 2008),
developed in collaboration with a team of Yine speakers and originally published in
1986. It was revised for a second edition published in 2008.

6.2Modifiers and NP-internal word order
The term ‘modifier’ is used in various ways in the literature. Here, I use it only to refer
to descriptive modifiers, those that describe some property of the head noun. In Yine,
the set of modifiers according to this definition includes adjectives, nouns, adverbs,
NPs and nominalizations; and it excludes the article, demonstratives, numerals, and
quantifiers. If I need to refer to the latter as a set, I will use the term ‘determiner
element’. This line is not purely descriptive but also has a syntactic basis. Within the
Yine NP, constituent order is fixed (in the order given in Table 6.1) for the determiner
elements, but flexible for modifiers.

10.1.4Expression and obligatoriness of core arguments
Core (VS, NVS, and O) arguments may be expressed in the Yine clause via pronominal
affixes on the predicate and/or via independent phrases. On verbal predicates, these
two expressions are in semi-complementary distribution: that is, they must co-occur
 256
in some situations and do not typically co-occur in others. Their co-occurrence is tied
in with both predicate type and constituent order in the clause. As described in §11.3,
the relative order of the predicate and its independent arguments (if any) is very fluid
in Yine, driven by pragmatic rather than syntactic motivations. If, in a given verbal
clause, there is an independent NP argument and it precedes the predicate, pronominal
indexing is optional (and pragmatically marked); in all other situations it is obligatory.
On nonverbal predicates, pronominal indexing is always obligatory.

Piro,"We can tie together these apparently contradictory conclusions if we substitute the
notion of ‘prominence’ in place of ‘pragmatic neutrality’. In Chapter 11, I describe
135
how constituent order in the clause core is flexible, and there is a tendency for new
and/or prominent information to precede old, established, topical or otherwise less
prominent information. The same strategy seems to be at work here in the NP.1
 In (293a) above, the adjective is in an NP that is completely isolated from any par-
ticular context; thus, the information it provides is necessarily new (and, presumably,
highly relevant because it was deliberately included). In (295), the adjective is under
focus because it is involved in an explicit contrast. Both examples are consistent in sug-
gesting that if the information provided by the adjective is relatively prominent (new,
focused or salient in the discourse context), the adjective is more likely to precede
the noun. The reverse tendency obtains if the adjective offers topical or established
information, or if the noun itself is more prominent. In general, this hypothesis is sup-
ported by the patterns in my corpus: a background or established modifier tends to
be expressed in post-nominal adjectives, and new and/or salient information brought
in via pre-nominal adjectives. This is the case in the examples in (296), where the
woman’s pot is first introduced (t1mate) and then identified as big (tsr1 himat1) with a
pre-nominal adjective in (296a). When this pot is referred to again two sentences later,
the same modifier follows the noun (296b).
(296) a.hawa t1mate, tsr1 himat1 . . .
hawa [ t1-himat1-e ]NP [ tsr1himat1 ]NP
and [ 3SGF P SSR-pot- PSSD ] [ big+MASC pot ]
‘and her pot, a big pot . . . ’ (Sns4)

wanet-kotp1ka-tka [ himat1 tsr1 ]NP : O
there/thus 3SGF-remove.lid- PFV [ potbig+MASC ]
‘Thus she took the lid off the big pot’ (Sns6)
 The example in (297) below offers a different sort of support for the prominence
hypothesis, and further suggests that it is the relative prominence between adjective
and noun that affects their order. This example is taken from a narrative about the
 1
 The word order parallels between clause and NP go beyond this: in both constructions word order
is flexible around the head and its closest syntactic neighbors, and more rigid in the periphery.

 The O arguments in (667) and (668) are not indexed on the predicate because they precede it in the
clause; they would be indexed if the order were reversed. See §3.2.2 regarding the effect of word order
on argument indexing.

Ket,"The following discussion of Ket verbal morphemics will begin with a presentation
of these five conjugations . This will be followed by a detailed presentation of
morphotactic rules, which pervade the whole verbal morphology; these rules are
unique in that they determine truncation and elision of morphological markers
(sometimes only parts of them) according to the actual presence or absence of
concrete fillers in the various morphemic slots; they do not react simply to the
phonetic surrounding of an affected morpheme, nor can they be described as
MORPHOLOGY 189
morphophonemic. We thus follow Edward Vajda, who first described these rules
for Ket (Vajda 2001) and dubbed them morphotactic.
Following this, the individual morpheme slots will be discussed one by one,
showing the possible fillers and their functions, as well as all phonetic distortions
they may be subject to (including, of course, again morphotactic rules, but also
phonotactic and other factors). The discussion of verbal morphology will then be
continued by sections on mood, especially imperatives (4.4.6). This is followed by
a more detailed description of derived categories (4.4.7). In this section, some
verbal categories, which are regularly expressed by the exploitation of this very
productive and versatile morphological technique, will be discussed, too, such as
causatives, and several aktionsart-like categories. Sections on nominal verb forms
(infinitives, ""participles""), ""copulae"" and predicative affixes, as well as a number of
illustrative paradigms - including those of truly idiosyncratic and irregular verbs -
conclude this chapter.
4.4.3The five conjugation classes
In order to be able to correctly inflect a given Ket verb, its conjugation class (or
simply conjugation) has to be known. Though most verbs (i.e. either verbal roots,
or derived verbs consisting of R plus either a P5 preverb, a P7 incorporate or both)
will typically belong to one of these conjugations, some fluctuation does also occur,
i.e. some verbs may be inflected according to more than one conjugational pattern
(and some paradigms mix forms from different conjugations). It is usually the case
that one speaker will conjugate a given verb according to one conjugational pattern
only; in some cases a speaker will be willing to accept a different pattern, too, but
equally often this may be rejected by some speakers, while accepted by others.
Generally, no difference in function or semantic content is entailed by such
alternatives (nor do the different conjugations as such express any clearly
determinable and fully operational semantic/functional content). The (albeit
limited) versatility of conjugational patterns for some verbs may reflect as yet
undetected dialectal (or subdialectal) differences, which could in principle be
elucidated by a full appraisal of all attested conjugated verb forms, but it seems also
to be likely that the functional ""emptiness"" of these patterns, together with ongoing
language death (which also led to some cases of first-language-attrition in formerly
fully competent speakers) leads to a certain degree of uncertainty on the side of
some speakers, how a given verb ""should"" be conjugated.
Some of the Ket conjugations are markedly characterized by grouping certain
argument positions together (or ""treating them alike"") against others, along the lines
of syntactic ""alignment"". Thus, conjugation I treats sentential subject and object in
what has been described as an ""active"" way, conjugation II may be referred to as
""ergative"" etc. This is the only grammatical domain of the language where such
instances of (non-nominative) alignment are found, and the use of an ""ergative"" or
""active"" verb in any construction does not exert any influence on the behaviour of
any other syntactic constituent.

In order to avoid misunderstandings about alignment in Ket, we mention the
respective orientation of the conjugation classes, but will refer to them simply as
""conjugation I, II, etc."" in the remainder of this grammar206.
The notion of transitivity is taken in its traditional (non-scalar) definition, i.e. a
transitive construction/verb will be one with (and an intransitive construction one
without) an overt patient/object.
4.4.3.1 Conjugation I
The sentential subject is encoded in P8 (for transitive and intransitive verbs),
objects are referenced in P4, P3, or P1.
The P8 subject morphemes, identical for singular and plural207, are:
1SG/PLdi
2SG/PLku
3SG/PLm du
3SG/PLf da208
The distribution of object morphemes in transitive verbs of this class is:
1SG P1di
2SG P1ku
3SGmP4a (o)209
3SGfP4i
3SGnP3b
1PL P1da~
2PL P1ka~
3PL P4a~ (o~)
Subject and object morphemes in the verbal chain of conjugation I verbs:
P8 P7 P6 P5 P4 P3P2P1RPL
dia (o)b di
kuiku
dua~ (o~)da~
da ka~
206
The essence of conjugations I-IV has been clearly worked out and described for the first
time by Comrie (1982). He summarizes the Ket agreement system in a table on p. 125
(terminology: DI affixes = our P8, BI affixes = our P6, DII affixes = our P1); his categories
may by and large be translated into our system as follows: a) Primary DI + Secondary Ø,
number agreement = conjugation I; Primary DI + Secondary BI, number agreement =
conjugation II; Primary DI + Secondary DII, variable number agreement = conjugation IV;
Primary DII + Secondary Ø, no number agreement = conjugation III.
207
Subject plural is signalled by the PL morpheme -Vn following R, discussed in 4.4.5.5.
208
The 3SGf subject morpheme da8- is subject to surface-changing rules discussed in
4.4.4.1

Tshangla," The devices to be discussed are postposing, pragmatic adverbials, and
sentence-final particles. Postposing, also known as 'right dislocation',
involves rearrangement of word order vis-a-vis the unmarked or default
syntactic order. The pragmatic adverbials and sentence-final particles are a
small closed class of uninflectable lexical items which occur syntactically at
the level of the sentence. The adverbials occur in various positions, while
the particles are added on to the end of a sentence after all other markers.
While formally quite different, these devices are functionally similar in that
they convey the speaker's attitudes or intentions in the particular situation.
Because pragmatic devices such as these are conditioned by the particular
circumstances of the speech situation, they are quite impossible to elicit
with any reliability. All of the data examples in this chapter are therefor
taken from spontaneously occurring natural discourse, for the most part
conversation between two or more speakers.

Tshangla,"Example (2) contrasts with example (1), in that the union here is at the
level of verb phrase or predicate, by which is meant the verb plus its object
arguments, but not including its subject. In other words, for this type, in
contrast to example (1), it will be claimed that there is only one subject
which is shared by both verbs. This construction will be called a 'serial
predicate' construction. 3
3 Solnit (1997) uses the term ""serial predicate"", to refer to concatenations of that constit-
uent which which contains a verb together with its objects, in order to distinguish this from
the serial verb construction, where the concatenated constituent includes the verb alone.
Foley and van Valin (cf. also Foley and Olson 1985; 1984; Van Valin and LaPolla 1997),
 CONCATENATION: THE NON-FINAL CONSTRUCTION 341
Example (3) shows the tightest bond, being a union of verbs without any
independent arguments at all. This is the familiar 'serial verb' construction
(Bruce 1988; Eynon 1985; Givan 1991; Lehmann 1988), also called 'verb
concatenation' (Wheatley 1985).4
Notice in the above examples that the verbs are adjacent in all three.
The surface absence of a second subject or object does not distinguish the
underlying structures of these examples. This is because of the tendency in
SOV languages toward zero anaphora, where shared arguments are often
omitted. It will be claimed below that there is an underlying structural dif-
ference which is often not apparent on the surface. The hypothesis to be
argued for in this section is that the underlying structures for ( 1) through
(3) are as shown in Figure 11.

4.8.2 Intentive
basic morph: <-lha>
label: INTEN
The intentive morpheme <-lha> denotes movement away from a
deictic referent in order to perform an event encoded by the main
verb. The intentive may also be used to indicate a transitional process
in some verbs with an experiencer subject. When used with a
dynamic verb, the intentive indicates that the subject moves away
from a referent with the intent to perform an activity, that is, with a
goal in mind. Hence, the intentive generally requires a volitional
subject. While the motion encoded by <-lha> is viewed as preceding
the action of the main verb, the completeness of the movement does
not necessarily entail completeness of the action, as is the case with
the distal, only that the subject went with the intention.

A clause marked with the intentive morpheme is similar to, yet
distinct from, the distal. The intentive denotes a telic event, even
when the verb is not inherently telic as in the following example with
the verb sikar ghali ‘to hunt’. In example (589), the event is viewed
as telic, with the subject moving from one location to another in order
to hunt. While in example (590), the event is construed as atelic, with
the subject moving along playing.

An intentive-marked verb may also differ from one marked with the
distal in regards to whom the action is performed for. In example
(591), the intentive indicates that the action is performed for someone
else, while in example (592) with the distal morpheme, the action is
performed for oneself.

7. The 6 personal pronouns are mostly self-explanatory. There is no gender distinction in the

Ő (he/she) and ők (they) are used for human subjects only. For animals, objects and abstract
nouns the demonstrative pronouns az (""that, it"") and azok (""those, they"") are used: az nem jó
""it's not good"", azok szépek ""they [animals, things, ideas] are pretty"".
The 2nd person pronouns and the corresponding verbal forms (sing. and plural) are used
pretty much like French ""tu"" and German ""du/ihr"". You would use these forms to address
children, close family members, friends, members of your peer group at university or in the
workplace, animals and God (assuming you speak to the last two ). Exact rules of usage are of
course quite intricate. Other people you would normally address by third person
pronouns/verbs and/or through the use of various appellatives (occupational titles etc.). But
let's leave this issue to some other time.
8. Personal pronouns are not necessary in unmarked speech - the verb ending already specifies
both the person and the number of the subject. If you do use a personal pronoun, it's for
emphasis or contrast:
Ő jön? - Is HE coming? (I already know what others are doing)
Te már itt vagy? - Are you already here? (What about the others?)
Én itt vagyok - I am here (as opposed to others who should be, but aren't...).
These contrast with unmarked forms:
Jön? - Is he coming?
Már itt vagy? - You are already here? (Mild surprise)
Itt vagyok - I am here. (Just a normal statement).

1. -ni is clearly the ending of the infinitive.
2. There is a connecting vowel between the stem and the ending in 4 out of the 6 forms. The
nature of this vowel depends on the vowel(s) in the stem: if the stem vowel is a back vowel,
the connecting vowel is a back vowel: o, u or a. If the last stem vowel is a front vowel, the
connecting vowel is also a front vowel: ö, ü or e. This is a manifestation of vowel harmony, a
typical feature of Uralic and Altaic languages. The rules for vowel harmony in Hungarian
can be quite complex - all I can say is that for simple verbs such as the ones here, it is
predictable.
3. There is no ending in the 3rd person singular - this is the unmarked form.
4. Where the forms of állni precede a consonant (e.g. állnak 'they stand'), the double
consonant is preserved in spelling, but it is reduced to a single consonant in pronunciation
(/a:lnOk/). This is an example of a general principle of Hungarian spelling: try to keep the
spelling of a morpheme uniform throughout the inflectional and derivational patterns.
---------------
Locative endings
We have already had the accusative ending -t. To be able to say simple sentences, we must
now introduce some nominal endings indicating location.
Hungarian does not have prepositions. Instead, it uses declensional endings and postpositions
to denote what prepositions denote in the European Indo-European languages (unlike, say,
Hindi and Japanese, which are more like Hungarian in this respect).
The first ending I introduce is -n. It means ""on"", so it will be easy to remember (this is
normally called the SUPERESSIVE case - don't let this deter you from learning it!)
When a noun ends in a vowel, the ending -n is generally simply added on to the noun:
ajtó (door) - ajtón (on the door)
tető (roof) - tetőn (on the roof)
fiú (boy) - fiún (on the boy).
One special rule: if the last vowel is a short -a or -e, this becomes long before the ending -n:
alma (apple) - almán (on the apple)
fecske (swallow [the bird]) - fecskén (on the swallow)
When the noun ends in a consonant, a connecting vowel must be inserted between the
consonant and the -n ending. This time we have three possibilities (-e-, -o-, -ö-), which obey
vowel harmony in a more complex way. Basically:
1) if the last stem vowel is -e- or -i- (short or long), the connecting vowel is -e-: kert (garden)
- kerten (on the garden), hír (news [may be singular in Hungarian]) - híren (on the news);
2) if the last stem vowel is -a-, -o- or -u- (short or long), the connecting vowel is -o-: asztal
(table) - asztalon (on the table), bor (wine) - boron (on the wine), út (road) - úton (on the
road). [Note the useful mnemonic here - the English preposition ""on"" can be translated by the
Hungarian ending -on! ];
3) if the last stem vowel is -ö- or -ü- (short or long), the connecting vowel is -ö-: könyv
(book) - könyvön (on the book), bűn (sin, crime) - bűnön (on the sin, on the crime).
EXERCISE
See if you can give me the Superessive of the nouns introduced in previous lessons:
ember - person, man (as German Mensch)
férfi - man (male adult)
nő - woman
kutya - dog
macska - cat
élet - life
isten - God
tanár - teacher
egér - mouse
-----------------------------
Some sentences with the superessive
We can now combine some newly acquired nouns and verbs to make meaningful sentences:
Állok az úton - I stand on the road.
Széken ülsz? - Are you sitting on a chair?
Van bor az asztalon? - Is there wine on the table?
Fecskék ülnek a tetőn - Swallows are sitting on the roof. [Title of a Hitchcock movie?]
-------------------------------
Important grammatical point.
I have used the term ""case"" to describe the accusative and the superessive so far. Note that,
unlike in Indo-European languages, there is no case agreement between a noun and the
adjectives qualifying it:
Látok egy piros könyvet - I see a red book.
A nagy asztalon nincs bor - There is no wine on the large table.
LESSON SIX
Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers
egy 'one' ~ első 'first'
NOTE: egy has an irregular pronunciation - it is spelled with a single <gy> but is pronounced
double, as if spelled *eggy.
kettő 'two' (reduced to két- in (most) compound numbers) ~ második 'second'
három 'three' ~ harmadik 'third'
From here on, the suffix -(linking vowel)dik is used (notice the vowel shifts for ordinal
formation - these are due to morphophonemic alternations seen in many aspects of grammar).
négy 'four' ~ negyedik 'fourth'
öt 'five' ~ ötödik 'fifth'
hat 'six' ~ hatodik 'sixth'
hét 'seven' ~ hetedik 'seventh'
nyolc 'eight' ~ nyolcadik 'eighth'
kilenc 'nine' ~ kilencedik 'ninth'
tíz 'ten' ~ tizedik 'tenth'
NOTE: Numerals between 11 and 19 are formed as follows:
11 - tizenegy ~ tizenegyedik (11th) (not *tizenelső!)
12 - tizenkettő ~ tizennkettedik (12th) (not *tizenmásodik!)
13 - tizenhárom ~ tizenharmadik (13th)
etc. (all of these forms consist of the units 1-9 being added to the superessive of 10; i.e.
Hungarians say: 1 on 10, 2 on 10 etc.)
Note: első and második are never found in compound numbers.
húsz 'twenty' ~ huszadik 'twentieth'
NOTE: Numerals between 21 and 29 are formed as follows:
21 - huszonegy ~ huszonegyedik (21st)
22 - huszonkettő ~ huszonkettedik (22nd)
23 - huszonhárom ~ huszonharmadik (23rd)
etc. (all of these forms consist of the units 1-9 being added to the superessive of 20; i.e.
Hungarians say: 1 on 20, 2 on 20 etc.)
harminc 'thirty' ~ harmincadik 'thirtieth'
NOTE: From here on, right up to 100, numerals are very simple: the decads followed by the
units, e.g.:
31 - harmincegy ~ harmincegyedik (31st)
32 - harminckettő ~ harminckettedik (32nd)
etc.
negyven 'forty' ~ negyvenedik 'fortieth'
ötven 'fifty' ~ ötvenedik 'fiftieth'
hatvan 'sixty' ~ hatvanadik 'sixtieth'
hetven 'seventy' ~ hetvenedik 'seventieth'
nyolcvan 'eighty' ~ nyolcvanadik 'eightieth'
kilencven 'ninety' ~ kilencvenedik 'ninetieth'
Now, five other noteworthy numerals are the following:
száz 'hundred' ~ századik 'hundredth'
ezer 'thousand' ~ ezredik 'thousandth'
millió 'million' ~ milliomodik 'millionth'
milliárd '[US] billion' ~ milliárdomodik 'billionth'
billió '[US] trillion' ~ billiomodik 'trillionth'
Note the continental patterns for 1E9 and 1E12.
Compound numerals are very easy, as is natural for an agglutinative language:
1956 - ezerkilencszázötvenhat
Above 2000, a hyphen is inserted between groups of 3 digits, counting from backwards:
2567 - kétezer-ötszázhatvanhét
However, this does not apply to numbers with three zeros at the end:
3000 - háromezer
--------
Some further notes:
1. As for the irregularities in the ordinals, in the case of első 'first' and második 'second' we
have suppletion, with the ordinals being related to elöl 'in front' and más 'other'.
2. On kettő vs két (two), usage is as follows:
- kettő is used:
-- in enumeration (egy, kettő, három = one, two, three);
-- when used as a noun: ketten jöttek - two (people) came (the -en form is a special case used
only with numbers which may have the same ultimate origin as the superessive, although not
always identical to it: négyen is both ""four of them"" and ""on four"", but for száz 'hundred' the
special form is százan 'one hundred of them' while the superessive is százon 'on one
hundred');
-- in arithmetic: kettő meg (or plusz) három az öt 'two plus three equal five'
- két is used as the attributive form: két fiú 'two boys', két alma 'two apples'.
3. You will note that in Hungarian the singular is used after numerals: két alma, not **két
almák. This is a very important difference between Hungarian and most IE languages
[apparently, Welsh is like Hungarian]. The accompanying verb is also in the singular: Jött
(not **Jöttek) két fiú 'two boys came'.
4. The fractional numbers are:
fél 'half'
harmad - third
negyed - quarter
ötöd - one fifth
etc.
These are combined normally with cardinals:
egyharmad - one third
kétötöd - two fifth
There is a special from for one and a half: másfél (lit. 'other half'; remember that the word for
'second' is derived from más as well: második)
5. This is a good opportunity to introduce time measurement.

Hungarian,"ALPHABET & VOWELS
But the demand is for Hungarian , so let's start with the sound system and the alphabet:
There are 7 pairs of vowels in Hungarian, spelled:
aáeéiíoóöőuúüű
The accented vowels are long, the others (including ö ü) are short. I shall be writing the long
umlaut ő with the tilde and the long umlaut ű with the circumflex, for the simple reason that
they are simpler to write on my keyboard - in any case, many Hungarians do the same. You
can look up the proper Unicode characters for these letters if you wish.
As for the pronunciation of the vowels, the long and the short vowels are pronounced alike,
with the exception of the pairs a / á and e / é.
a = [Q], more or less. It is closest to English a in all. Ex: alma 'apple'.
á = [a:], like French cave, Spanish or Italian casa. Ex: ár 'price; flood; awl; 100 sq.m.'
e = [E], like English e in pet (but not the way the Australians or NZs pronounce it!); or like
French sept. Ex: ember 'man, human being'.
é = [e:] - like French été, but longer; or like English say, but without diphthongization. Ex:
szél 'wind [n.]'
For the other vowels, the long and short versions have the same quality - they only differ in
quantity. I shall try to give the equivalents of the long vowels - it's easier to find foreign
equivalents:
í = [i:], i = [i]: Like English sea, but with no noticeable diphthongization. Exs: szív 'heart';
visz 'he carries'.
ó = [o:], o = [o]: Like North American English boat, but with no diphthongization; or like
French saute. Exs: ló 'horse'; lovak 'horses'. NOTE: Word-final -ó is always long, there is just
one word with a word-final short -o: the interjection nono! 'don't do it!' For Hungarians, even
Torontó has a long final -ó.
ő = [ø:] (I don't know the SAMBA for this!), ö = [ø]. If you know German, it's like German ö.
Or French beurre. If you must use an English analogy, as in British English pearl. Exs: nő
'woman; it's growing'; lövök 'I shoot'. NOTE: The word-final length rule is even more
absolute: any -ő at the end of the word must be long.
ú = [u:], u = [u]: Like English oo in moon, but with no noticeable diphthongization; or like
French tour. Exs: túl 'beyond'; fut 'he is running'.
ű = [y:], ü = [y]: Like German ü, or French u in dur. Exs: tű 'needle'; fül 'ear'.
------------
That's it for the vowels. No real diphthongs (except for recent loanwords like autó 'car',
Európa 'Europe'), no schwas, no tones. Stress is strong and always on the first syllable.
CONSONANTS
Today I will cover Hungarian consonantism.
Some preliminary remarks:
1. Voiceless stops are not aspirated.
2. Dental consonants are truly post-dental, as in most European languages - none of this
alveolar stuff you find in English.
3. Word-final voiced consonants remain fully voiced, unlike in German, Dutch and most
(all?) Slavic languages.
4. Just like neighbouring Slavic languages, Hungarian has a full range of palatal consonants.
But palatalization as a conditioning process does not exist: any consonant, palatal or not, can
occur before any vowel.
5. Consonants can be single or doubled, and the distinction is phonemic: néz 'he looks', nézz
'look [imperative]'.
------------------
The list of consonants, in traditional spelling order, is as follows:
b c cs d dz dzs f g gy h j k l ly m n ny p r s sz t ty v z zs
Of these, b d h k m n p t v and z call for no explanation.
c cs dz and dzs are affricates - essentially [ts] [tS] [dz] and [dZ], respectively.
gy and ty are alveolar palatal stops, similar to what you hear in British English dune and tune.
But they are definitely unitary phonemes, and despite their ""asymetrical"" spelling they are
truly a voiced-voiceless pair, articulated in the same place in the mouth. The IPA symbol for
gy is a dotless <j> with a line drawn through it, the one for ty is /c/.
j and ly are different spellings for the same phoneme: IPA /j/, or English /y/ in yard. There
was a time when ly was the palatal lateral heard in some varieties of Spanish <ll> (and
Catalan, right, Izopiru?) and in Portuguese <lh>, but this is no longer the case. But it is
important to know which spelling to use: spell bagoly 'owl' as *bagoj, and you'll be surely
labelled illiterate - Hungarians are a lot stricter on this kind of thing than English speakers.
l has the same light/dark distinction that you have in British English, and - just as in English -
this is an allophonic, not phonemic distinction. Normally, /l/ is ""light"" before a vowel and
""dark"" before a consonant or word-finally.
ny - Izopiru would be glad to learn that this has the same pronunciation as in Catalan. This is
the palatal nasal sound spelled ñ in Spanish, gn in French and Italian and nh in Portuguese.
r - this is the trilled consonant you hear in Italian, Spanish and Russian. Have a lot of fun
pronouncing it - trill away! I was 7 when I learned how to pronounce it, I still remember the
trill (and thrill) of it.
s and sz - these consonants have the opposite value from Polish: <s> = /S/ and <sz> = /s/.
zs = /Z/, as in English pleasure, or the way French, Italian and Catalan pronounce <j> and
<g> before e,i.
---------------------------------
The letters <q> and <w> are not used except in very recent loanwords (w mostly in the
physical measurement unit watt and the common word for toilet, WC /ve:ts:e/; q only in
foreign names). The letter <x> is relatively common in words of Latin and Greek origin:
export, hexaméter, etc.
The letter y is used to denote a palatal consonant: gy, ly, ny, ty. In addition, it commonly (but
not always) replaces word-final -i in family names. When so used, it tends to denote the name
of a noble family: Esterházy (where the <s> represents /s/, against the normal rules of the
language), Csáky and so on.
LESSON 1
(a) Simple sentences
Ez könyv. - This is a book.
Az könyv. - That is a book.
Ezek könyvek. - These are books.
Azok könyvek. - Those are books.
Commentary:
There is clearly no need for a verb in sentences expressing identity. At least not in the present
tense.
There is also no need for an article in such sentences. That does not mean that there is no
indefinite article in the language - there is. But we'll get to it another time.
(b) Simple questions.
Ez könyv? (with rising intonation). - Is this a book?
Igen, ez könyv. - Yes, this is a book.
Nem, ez nem könyv. - No, this is not a book.
Ezek könyvek? - Are these books?
Igen, ezek könyvek. - Yes, these are books.

Hungarian,"Definite (objective) conjugation
Without getting into this can of worms, it will be difficult to develop meaningful sentences.
Basically, all finite verb forms in Hungarian come in two varieties: definite and indefinite.
Let's take some new verbs and conjugate them with the endings we have had so far (see
Lesson 5):
ütni (to hit): ütök, ütsz, üt, ütünk, üttök, ütnek
látni (to see): látok, látsz, lát, látunk, láttok, látnak
The above are the indefinite forms. To make the definite forms, you have to use a different set
of endings:
ütni (to hit): ütöm, ütöd, üti, ütjük, ütitek, ütik
látni (to see): látom, látod, látja, látjuk, látjátok, látják.
If you compare the endings of the definite forms with those of the possessive, you'll see that
they are very similar.
Quick overview of when to use the definite and when to use the indefinite forms:
1. You use the indefinite form:
a. when there is no object:
Ki jön? - Who is coming?
Előbb ütök, aztán kérdezek - I hit first, then I ask (questions).
b. when the object is indefinite:
Látok egy kutyát. - I see a dog.
Láttok valamit? - Do you see something?
2. You use the definite form:
a. when the object is definite:
Látom a kutyát. - I see the dog.
Üti a labdát? - Is he striking the ball?
b. When the object is in the possessive (even if it's not preceded by the definite article):
Látom kutyádat. - I see your dog.
c. To express a 3rd person definite object (no personal pronoun needed):
Látod? - Do you see him/her/it?
Ütjük. - We are hitting it.
Thus we can use these resources of the language to express very simply the following
distinction:
Nem látok. - I don't see (i.e. ""I can't see"")
Nem látom. - I don't see him/her/it.

Hungarian,"The alert reader may have noticed that adjectives agree in number with the noun they are
complementary to, but remain in the singular when they qualify them.
-------------------------------
Let's introduce some people:
Ez a fiú. This is the boy.
Ez a lány. This is the girl.
Ezek a fiúk. These are the boys.
Ezek a lányok. These are the girls.
A lány okos. The girl is clever.
A fiúk okosak. The boys are clever.
A fiú nem okos. The boy is not clever.
A lányok nem okosak. The girls are not clever.
Az okos lány magyar. The clever girl is Hungarian.
Az okos fiú nem magyar. The clever boy is ot Hungarian.
-----------------------------------
Here we are at the end of LESSON 2, and we have still not seen a verb! And all the sentences
are well-formed, with the exception of a few noun phrases. The latter illustrate the fact that
qualifiers always precede the noun. Thus the famous free word order is not really free word
order at all:
ADJ. + NOUN = Qualifier + Qualified (e.g. the red book)
NOUN + ADJ. = Statement ascribing quality to the noun (e.g. the book is red).
LESSON THREE
I will still keep things simple. It's time to tackle verbs, but I will show that the unmarked form
of verbs is used for the 3rd person singular, present tense (with no definite object, but that
complication is for the future!).
New vocabulary:
egy - one; a/an (the definite article) [NB: this is one of the few irregular spellings of the
language - the word is pronounced with a double voiced palatal stop, as if spelled *eggy]
az ember - the person, man (as German Mensch)
a férfi - the man (male adult)
a nő - the woman
a kutya - the dog
a macska - the cat
az egér - the mouse
az élet - life
az isten - God
jön - comes
megy - goes
fut - runs
lát - sees
hall - hears
szép - beautiful
Thus:
A lány fut. The girl is running.
A fiú jön. The boy is coming.
A fiú lát egy kutyát. The boy sees a dog.
A kutya lát egy fiút. The dog sees a boy.
Jön az ember. (There) comes the man.
Megy a nő. (There) goes the woman.
A férfi hall egy macskát. The man hears a cat.
A macska hall egy egeret. The cat hears a mouse.
-----------------------------------
GRAMMATICAL POINTS
1. Articles have now been formally introduced. The definite article (""the"") is a before a
consonant, az before a vowel. You may recall from LESSON ONE that az also means ""that""
(the demonstrative pronoun) - the relationship is clear. Note that as a demonstrative the word
is always az, even before a consonant:
az kutya - that is a dog
a kutya - the dog
The indefinite article is egy, identical to the numeral ""one"".
Articles are used more like they are in French and German, less like in English: for example,
the definite article is required before abstract nouns:
Az élet szép. Life is beautiful.
Also, the indefinite article is not needed in expressions like:
Az könyv. That is a book.
It's not wrong to say ""Az egy könyv"", but if you say it like that there may be an emphasis on
there being other books in the world. This may be trivial, but there is definitely a difference
between:
Az Isten. That is God.
Az egy isten. That is a god.
I'd expect that no monotheist would normally use the second option!
2. I have also introduced the first of many declensional endings: the accusative -t. This must
practically always be used for the direct object (the few exceptions will come up eventually).
We have seen the plural -k already, so - rather than bore people with intricate rules - I will go
through the nouns we have covered so far, and provide both the corresponding accusative and
plural endings (you can also have both together, but that's for another time). When both
endings are added on to the bare stem, I shall just use a hyphen:
könyv: könyvet, könyvek (book)
fiú: -t, -k(boy)
lány: lányt, lányok (girl)
ember: embert, emberek (person, man)
férfi: férfit, férfiak : (man (male adult))
nő: -t, -k (woman)
kutya: kutyát, kutyák (dog)
macska: macskát, macskák (cat)
egér: egeret, egerek (mouse)
élet: életet, életek (life)
isten: istent, istenek (God)
The morphophonemics are quite complex - see if you can see some patterns already.
3. The verbs are all simple ones. Note that in the present indicative (e.g. fut) they can
correspond to both the English simple present (""he runs"") and the continuous present (""he is
running"").
4. A point of syntax: When the verb precedes the subject (e.g. jön a lány ""there comes the
girl""), this is a marked expression - there is an emphasis on the action, rather than on the
person.
LESSON FOUR
The verb ""to be"" (lenni), personal pronouns and negation.
New vocabulary
lenni - to be
tanár: tanárt, tanárok - teacher
szép - beautiful, pretty
itt - here
ott - there
már - already
The verb ""to be"" in the present tense, with attendant personal pronouns:
én vagyok - I am
te vagy - you [sing.] are
ő van - he/she is
mi vagyunk - we are
ti vagytok - you [pl.] are
ők vannak - they are
(Personal endings in bold)
---------------------
GRAMMATICAL AND USAGE POINTS
1. Clearly, the verb ""to be"" has a suppletive present tense.
2. There are three main uses of ""lenni"":
(i) Identity + characterization: okos vagy ""you are clever"", tanár vagyok ""I am a teacher"".
(ii) Physical location: itt vagyok ""I am here"", ott vagytok? ""are you there?""
(iii) Existence (English there is/are, French il y a): Van itt kutya? ""Is there a dog here?"" (in
fact it means ""are there dogs here?), vannak ott lányok? ""are there girls there?"", igen, vannak
""yes, there are"".
3. With meaning (i), the verb is omitted in the 3rd person singular and plural (in the present
tense, at any rate): ő okos ""he/she is clever"", ők tanárok ""they are teachers"".
4. Negation is always expressed by using the negative particle ""nem"" before the verb: nem
vagyok tanár ""I am not a teacher"", nem jön a fiú ""the boy is not coming"".
5. There are special combined forms for expressing negation + verb with the 3rd person forms
of the verb lenni:
nincs(en) - is not
nincsenek - are not
Examples: itt nincs kutya ""there is no dog here"", nincsenek ott ""They are not there"".
""Nincsen"" sounds (to me) a bit more formal than ""nincs"", but I don't think there is a
systematic difference between the two forms.
",,No dominant order,,,0,0,
Hungarian,"The key nouns are:
óra 'hour, o'clock'
perc 'minute'
másodperc 'second'
Normally the forms are as expected:
egy óra - one o'clock
hét óra - seven o'clock
In everyday usage, the 12-hour clock is used, so that egy óra can mean 1 am or 1 pm. The 24-
hour clock (e.g. tizenhárom óra = 13 o'clock) may be heard in military and timetable
language.
For fractions of hours, the hour referred to is the hour to come, not the hour just passed - this,
I believe, is identical to German usage:
negyed hét (""quarter seven"") - 6:15
fél hét (""half seven"") - 6:30
háromnegyed hét (""three-quarters seven"") - 6:45
6. To denote the time at which something happens, Hungarian has a special case ending -kor,
which does not follow vowel harmony rules. It is clearly based on the agglutinated form of the
noun kor 'age, epoch'.
Thus you say:
egykor jön 'he comes at one o'clock'
háromnegyed hatkor itt van 'he is here at 5:45'
ötkor itt lesz 'he'll be here at 5'
You can also add -kor to óra 'o'clock':
öt órakor még itt volt 'at 5 o'clock he was still here'.
LESSON SEVEN
Possessives
Unlike IE languages, Hungarian expresses possession by adding a personal suffix to the end
of the noun. You could say that Hungarian conjugates its nouns.
Because of vowel harmony considerations, as well as other morphophonemic changes, the
vowel preceding the possessive suffix varies. Let's see the patterns for 3 types of nouns:
consonantal endings with front and back vocalism, and vowel ending. The paradigms will be:
könyv (book), lány (girl, daughter), alma (apple).

Apinayé,"A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal
 the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent
 clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in
 subordinate clauses) existing among them. Panará, on the other hand, is dramatically
 distinct from the other languages of the branch. It displays a more polysynthetic
 morphological typology, with agent, patient and tense/aspect/modality (TAM) marking on
 the verb; ergative marking in independent clauses and SVO word order, among other
 things.18

Apinayé," The Apinajé grammatical word can be identified according to some of the criteria
listed in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19-25). First, the grammatical word is internally
cohesive, both formally, since its components constitute a bound unit; and semantically,
because that unit conveys a conventionalized meaning. Secondly, the component
92
morphemes of a grammatical word in Apinajé follow a particular order, with word clitics
always occupying the outermost final position in the word, thus indicating the word final
boundary, and person prefixes appearing in first position, when applicable, thus
indicating the word-initial boundary. Thirdly, speakers generally utter the word without
interruptions or pauses, except in case of hesitations, clarifications or factors of this sort,
which are part of natural speech in any language. Finally, the Apinajé grammatical word
can constitute a complete utterance by itself.
2.3. Word-formation strategies
Mechanisms of word formation in Apinajé include affixation and compounding, and
phonological strategies such as vowel alternation, reduplication, and suppletion. These
are discussed in what follows.
2.3.1. Affixation
Prefixes are more numerous than suffixes in Apinajé. Affixes encode inflectional and
derivational categories; they have no stress properties but may participate in segmental
alternations.

Apinayé,"In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammatical
relations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according to
language internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems of
alignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant for
the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:
(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé
(a) word order
(b) person prefixes
(c) independent pronouns
(d) person inflection in imperative clauses
(e) the use of reflexives
(f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination
(g) switch-reference strategies
(h) valency-changing operations
(i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
(j) equi-deletion in complementation
(k) coreferential deletion in coordination
The SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful
criterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-
 255
intransitive system in simple main clauses, and an absolutive pattern in nonfinite clauses.
To go along with the absolutive pattern, criterion (i) reveals an ergative case-marking
system that is conditioned by subordination environments. All other criteria (c-h; j-k)
betray a nominative pattern and provide strong support for the grammatical relation

than universal criteria, which may not apply to every language. In regard to the definition
of a grammatical word, however, they offer what they see as a set of universal criteria.
Their list is as follows:
A grammatical word consists of a number of grammatical elements which:
 (a) always occur together, rather than scattered through the clause (the
 criterion of cohesiveness);
 (b) occur in a fixed order;
 (c) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning. (...)
 (d) Morphological processes involved in the formation of words tend to be
 non-recursive. That is, one element will not appear twice in a word. (...)
 (e) There will be just one inflectional affix per word. (...)
 (f) A speaker may pause between words but not within a word. (...)
 (g) A word may constitute a complete utterance, all by itself (Dixon and

As noted above, whereas Dogon and many other Niger-Congo languages have agglutinating

these distinctions are expressed through unbound morphemes in Bangime, and are thus
covered in the following section on syntactical aspects of the language.
2.3 Syntactic structure
2.3.1Noun phrase
The main constituents in the noun phrase include a definite marker, possessive marker,
modifiers, and post positions. All of these follow the head noun, except for the definite and
possessive markers. Based on this information, it would appear that the basic word order of
Bangime is SOV, but as shown below, the situation is more complex.
Examples are illustrated as follows in (10).

Also, note in the examples in (80) that some elicited phrases and sentences from texts were
translated in the perfective form though the clitic was not used, and the word order shifts.
This deserves further investigation since the tone plays an important factor as discussed in
section 4.5.3.1 on grammatical tone patterns.

Because of the lack of segmental morphology, tone also plays an important role among the
constituents in the noun phrase, particularly among pro-clitics such as possessives and a
definite article, and post-clitics such as adjectives and determiners.
2.3.2Main clauses and constituent order
When the subject and object are both unfocalized nonpronominal NPs, the word order is
SOV, as shown in (13)
 (13)
 nàá dà màà tìíⁿ nʒìɾìŋɡà
 cow IMPERF 3 SG
 rd
tail POSS swing
 ‘The cow swings its tail.’
In the negative forms, there is a binary distinction between the perfective and imperfective
aspect as shown in the examples here, which also show the evidence for syllable timing in
the language through the phonological process of vowel-r deletion, shown in the examples
in (13).
 (14)

mmʷɔ́ɔ ̀à jìmɛ̀ m béà jìmɛ̀ m= màà
1st SG like.NEG DEF person1st SG NEG DEF person Tlike
‘I did not like the person’ ‘I do not like the person’
Positive phrases in (13) support this conclusion further. The ordering of constituents in the
verb phrase continues to depend on the tense/aspect/mood of the phrase, as shown in the
phrases. These examples are only the most basic TAM distinctions in the language asbverbs
indicate TAM distinctions depending on their phonological shape as well. Thus this verb,
‘hit’, as shown in c. takes a suffix –u, which can also be described as changing the final
vowel of the verb stem, but this is not the case for all verbs in the language.
The example in d. illustrates the future tense. Note first that the ‘auxiliary’ is an allomorph
of the same ‘auxiliary’ or TAM marker employed in b, the imperfective.
Therefore, the tense is formed by word order. Verb classes, based on the phonological
shape of the verb form, determine the method by which they are marked for TAM whether
it be umlaut, consonantal mutation, a change in the final vowel, or tonal.

Also, note that in the examples in (14) if the future tense phrase contains an object, it

and mood differ. Therefore, the very rare word order, OSV is attested in the language.

orders of the subject, object and verb are generally possible, though
there are some word orders that very frequently occur in the language,
while others are uncommon. The most frequent change in word order
caused by pragmatic status is the focalization and fronting of the object:
O A V. This is for instance the case in the following example, where the

Vowel harmony is among the most remarkable characteristics of Karajá phonology.
Common in African languages, [ATR] vowel harmony is exceedingly rare outside of Africa;
Karajá presents the first documented case of this type of vowel harmony in South America.
Since most languages presenting [ATR] vowel harmony are genetically or areally related, the
Karajá case provides a different perspective for the typological understanding of the
phenomenon (Ribeiro 2002). Once again, the chapter does not provide the final word on the
subject, indicating instead additional topics for investigation; for instance, a thorough
accoustic analysis of the vowel inventory is yet to be conducted, in order to investigate
whether the mechanisms underlying [ATR] distinctions in Karajá are similar to those found
in better-known languages.

Karajá,"The case of Karajá (as well as a brief observation of other languages of the stock)
suggests that one must be cautious in analyzing descriptive predicates as verbs in Macro-Jê

languages. In cases in which there are clear criteria to distinguish nouns and verbs,
descriptive predicates tend to behave mostly like nouns. For example, in Karajá a verb must
first be nominalized in order to appear in a descriptive predicate. Consequently, one must
also be cautious in relying on the behavior of descriptive predicates as a sole criterion to
propose active-stative systems.

6. Final remarks
This chapter described the morphology of Karajá, focusing especially on the
inflectional and derivational properties of nouns and verbs. A thorough description of verb
and noun morphology makes it possible to determine the morphosyntactic position of
‘descriptives’, i.e. lexemes that denote adjectival meanings. Contrary to previous analyses
(Fortune 1973, Maia 1986), the description provided here demonstrates that descriptives are
in fact nouns. A conclusive proof of their nominal nature is the fact that, in order to be used
as a descriptive word, a verb must be first nominalized, which is particularly clear in cases
for which nominalization is indicated by consonantal replacement.
",,SOV,,,0,0,
Karajá," The iambic nature of stress assignment in Karajá is especially clear with
morphologically complex words. Notice that, in compounds, the original stress pattern of the
individual stems is ‘rearranged’ in order to follow the iambic pattern. One can assume that,
although stems can be said to carry stress, the position of such stress is not underlyingly
predetermined. Although the stress is, by default, assigned to the last syllable of a stem, its
ultimate position will depend on the morphological or syntactic position of the stem. That is
illustrated below by a compound (5a), a case of derivational suffixation (6b), and by a
vocative phrase involving the vocative interjection, which is stressed (7b). The behavior of
the stress if further illustrated in (8) and (9), which show stress (re-)assignment under
suffixation (8b) and compounding (9b). As shown in (9c), a possessive phrase such as
brOrE-d¸) hUk´)-TÈ ‘cow’s milk’ can be pronounced as two words (in which case both preserve
their primary stress) or as a single phonological word.

the other hand, can be identified by their position and by the circumstance that, when
pronominal, they are obligatorily incorporated into the verb (29). However, when both
subject and object are nouns, they can only be distinguished by the word order, canonically

Cholón,"Traces of this long tradition of language description are found in the Arte de la
Lengua Cholona. Pedro de la Mata also opens his grammar with sounds and he also
ends with prosody. In the first paragraph of the ALC de la Mata talks, among other
things, about unfamiliar sounds and at the end of the grammar there is a remark
about stress. Traditionally, he distinguishes five moods and five tenses and declines
the noun as a Latin noun producing a paradigm with six cases (nominative, genitive,
dative, accusative, ablative, vocative). In addition, Pedro de la Mata often uses the
Latin terminology, for instance, to designate the tenses: praesens, imperfectum,
perfectum, plus quam perfectum, futurum. Like the Latin grammarians Pedro de la
Mata distinguishes in Cholón:
(a) eight parts of the sentence: noun, pronoun, verb, participle, postposition, adverb,
interjection, conjunction (since Cholón has no prepositions - directives, locatives
and the like are suffixed to a noun or a nominal form - Pedro de la Mata replaced the
preposition with the postposition);
(b) a gerund and a participle which are not considered as separate parts of the
sentence;
(c) four gerund cases: genitive, dative, accusative and ablative;
(d) supines I and II;
(e) two indicative future tenses: imperfect and perfect.
It is understandable that de la Mata recurs to Latin and to the Latin paradigms in his
description of Cholón. As a priest, he was familiar with Latin and the Latin
grammar. He was probably also influenced by Nebrija. In an article about colonial
48
grammars of indigenous Colombian languages, Christine Dümmler (1997: 413-432)
remarks that these grammars are based on Nebrija’s Introductiones Latinae from
1481; and that the writers of the colonial grammars analyzed by her had taken
Nebrija’s description of Latin as a model in order to describe the Amerindian
language. In the introduction of their textedition of the Introductiones Latinae from
1488, a bilingual Latin - Spanish grammar, Esparza and Calvo (1996: xxiv) remark
that Nebrija himself makes a distinction between an “orden natural de la gramática”
‘natural order of grammar’, which is used to describe the own language, and an
“orden de la doctrina” ‘doctrinaire order’, which is used for the description of a
foreign langauge. The former order starts with a complete explanation of the
‘letters’ (sounds) followed by that of syllables, words and the parts of the sentence
in order to end with a discussion about belles-lettres. The latter starts with a short
overview of the ‘letters’, syllables and parts of the sentence, and ends with
paradigms illustrating the declension and conjugation of words and verbs. On page
xxiii Esparza and Calvo show that this is indeed the order which Nebrija employs
when he - in Book V of his Gramática de la Lengua Castellana - teaches Spanish to
non-Spanish speakers. As we have seen, this order is more or less followed by
Pedro de la Mata. However, conversely to what Nebrija prescribes, he does not end
with paradigms. Paradigms are found in different sections, and de la Mata ends with
some observations about structure of the sentence, accent, pronunciation and
orthography. The influence of Nebrija’s Gramática de la Lengua Castellana is
mainly noticeable in the fact that, like Nebrija, de la Mata also adds alternative
paradigms to the five tenses, representing them in otra manera ‘another way’; and
that he also uses the words o si ‘oh if’ and ojalá ‘I hope’ to form an optative. Pedro
de la Mata furthermore distinguishes a permissive, a prohibitative and a dubitative.
As a consequence, his conjugation of a verb presents a large amount of paradigms
(36) and forms (219, including a participle form and 2 gerund forms which do not
occur in a paradigm, but appear as independent forms). Table 3.2 gives an overview
of Pedro de la Mata’s arrangement of the verb. It gives evidence of the profusion of
paradigms (and forms) distinguished by de la Mata.
",,SOV,,,0,0,
Cholón,"An additional consequence of the fact that the orthography was not regulated
yet is that two separate words could be written as a single word, whereas a word
consisting of two morphemes could be written as two words. For instance,
according to Pedro de la Mata, the optative preterite of the verb ‘to be’ is
alternatively written as cotte moc cot, cottemoc cot or cotte moccot ‘he wished to
be’. On further consideration, the second option, cottemoc cot, appears to be the
most appropriate transcription for the expression ‘he wished to be’. The morpheme
moc ‘wished’ can, in fact, be analyzed as a nominal suffix, and it is only in cottemoc
cot that it is indeed represented as a suffix. In this form moc is suffixed to a
nominalized form (the infinitive) of the verb cotan ‘to be’. In the other options, cotte
moc cot and cotte moccot, the suffix moc is represented as a detached morpheme
and as a prefix, respectively.
3.3.2. Purpose and register
Most of the colonial grammars or artes were written by priests or missionaries. In
order to be able to preach the Word of God and to make as many converts as
possible in a certain region, they had to learn the language of the people living in
that area. A grammar of the language was thus a great help - not only for them, but
also for later generations of missionaries - when they had to translate Bible verses,
prayers, hymns, and when they had to write a sermon. The artes of Franciscan friars
were primarily written for missionary purposes. When a priest was transferred, his
grammar together with all his notes, translations and sermons was left behind for his
successor. Being of domestical use, the material of the book was sometimes
unordered. For instance, in the Arte de la Lengua Cholona the section about verbos
compuestos ‘compound verbs’ occurs twice, and that of the transiciones
‘transitions’ (fol. 83 recto - 89 verso) is completed elsewhere (fol. 125 recto - 126
recto). Another characteristic which Pedro de la Mata’s grammar has in common
45
with many other artes is the language register which is used in the examples. Since
the grammar was written with the objective to preach the Gospel, the register of the
phrases which illustrate all kinds of grammatical facts is predominantly religious
and the tone is often moralistic (the spelling of the following example is the one as
proposed in chapter 4):
mi Pedro me-kt-aõ, ko ta nyan-te a-n-iglesia-wo-kt-aõ
2s Pedro 2sS-be-IA this stone face-AD 1sP-REL-church-VB-F-IA
‘You are Peter, [and] on this stone I shall build my church.’
kolo…o ixiwah ø-kot-aõ, utsa-wa koli-mit-aõ
death big bad 3sS-be-IA sin-TO death 3sA-3sO.exceed-IA
‘It is better to die, than to sin.’ (literally: ‘Death is a great evil, but sin exceeds it.’)
3.3.3. Tradition and model
From time immemorial men have thought about language and its structure, and our
grammars are built on the works of earlier generations of philosophers. Many
linguistic concepts which we use today were already common property in classical
antiquity. Plato, for instance, observed that time can be segmented into past, present
and future (Quilis, 1980: 32). According to Aristotle, Protagoras distinguished
masculine from feminine and inanimate (Quilis, 1980: 27). Aristotle introduced,
amongst other things, the concepts of subject and predicate (Van Peursen, 1958:
82). He also introduced categories like substance, quantity, quality, possession,
situation, action and subjection (Störig, 1988: 167). In his Technè ‘art’, Dionysius
the Thracian, +/- 200-100 B.C. (Lallot, 1989: 40-65) distinguished seven vowels: a,
e, ‘, i, o, Ç, u; five moods: indicative, imperative, optative, conjunctive, infinitive,
and divided the sentence into eight constituents: noun, pronoun, verb, participle,
article, preposition, adverb, conjunction. In addition, he gives the complete
conjugation of a verb. Latin philosophers such as Varro, 116- 26 B.C. (Collart,
1954), Donatus, +/- 350 A.D. (Keil, 1864, IV: 353-402), Priscian, +/- 600 A.D.
(Keil, 1855-59, II-III) adopted Aristotle’s philosophical observation about time
consisting of past, present and future, and crystallized these notions into tenses,
subdividing the past into praeteritum perfectum, imperfectum and plus-quam-
perfectum. Like Dionysius the Thracian, they also distinguished five moods and
eight partes orationis ‘parts of the sentence’ including the interjection but excluding
the article. The works in question of the philosophers mentioned above, except for
Dionysius’ Technè, are purely theoretical. In the books concerned the writers
philosophize about grammatical questions; they do not give paradigms. (Dionysius
was the first theoretician who gave a paradigm as an illustration). This is because
language teaching was not the aim; their writings were not meant to be used as
grammars. Rather, their first objective was to teach poetics and poetic diction. The
second objective was to teach the reader to value poetry. As a consequence, these
works have a specific structure. Since knowledge of the structure of the language
was a pre-requisite for poetic diction, the philosophers began the book with a
46
dissertation about voice and sounds or ‘elements’. The chapter about voice and
elements was followed by chapters in which the syllable, the word and the sentence
were successively discussed. The last part of the book, the largest part, was devoted
to prosody and to poetry itself. In this part, fragments of works of great poets were
shown in order to illustrate the beauty and supremacy of the art of poetry. The same
objectives and the same ordering (voice/ sounds - syllables - words - sentences -
prosody/ poetry) are encountered in the first non-Latin grammar: the Gramática de
la Lengua Castellana written by Antonio de Nebrija in the year of 1492. However,
besides the ambition to teach and promote Spanish poetry, Nebrija also sought to
teach the Spanish language to those who did not have Spanish as their mother
tongue. He wrote the last book of his grammar (Book V) “for those who want to
learn Spanish”. Therefore, Nebrija gives, among other things, a thorough analysis of
the Spanish vowels and consonants, an adapted version of the current spelling,
several nominal paradigms, and the conjugation of a verb (like Dionysius did in his
Technè), casu quo the verb amar ‘to love’. The Spanish noun and verb are still
treated, partly, after the Latin model. Nebrija declines the Spanish noun and
attributes to it the same cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative,
vocative) as Latin has - he does the same with the adjectives, the pronouns and the
relatives -, and, as far as the verb is concerned, he also distinguishes five moods
(indicative, imperative, optative, subjunctive, infinitive) and five tenses (see below).

In the following example, the direct object of y(a)… ‘(to) see’ is a third person
singular, so that the form mi-tsa… can be interpreted as ‘you see it’ or as ‘you see
him’. In this case, the form in -(e)…, i-m-kole-… ‘(the fact) that he loves you’
functions as a direct object clause:

When the form in -(e)… functions as an attributive extension of the direct object, the

be co-referential:

The suffix -e…/-(k)t-e… is used to form a resultative or a purposive clause. When this
suffix is used, the subject of the main verb and the subordinated verb are not co-
referential. The form -e… is found after reduced verb stems of class 1; -(k)t-e… (which
contains the future marker -(k)t(e)) is encountered after non-reduced verb stems of
class 2, 3 and 5 (see Table 7.6). (The ending -(k)t-e… is not found with a class 4 verb
stem. This may be attributed to a lack of data). The -e… forms occurring with class 1

7.2.4. Prefix order
As stated before, in a verb form personal reference markers occur before the verb
stem, and agent markers normally precede object markers: A-O-stem. However,
when the agent is a second person and the object the first person plural, the latter
precedes the former: 1pO-2A-stem(-SE)(-ha). This reversed order may cause
ambiguity. For instance, the form
(113)ki-m-koly-aõ (1664)
 1pO-2sA-love-IA
 ‘you love us’
can also be interpreted as 1pA-2sO-love-IA ‘We love you’. In addition, the second
person agent marker can be followed by the applicative marker -(h)a, which then
relates to the first person plural object:
(114)ki-sakki-m-a-pu…-aõ (1689)
 1pPOS-food 1pO-2sA-APL-put.down-IA
 ‘You put down our food [for us]’.
In the alternative case, the applicative marker (see section 7.2.5) is suffixed to the
object marker, not to the subject or agent marker: S/A-O-APL-stem, so that the
example above would be interpreted as 1pPOS-food 1pA-2sO-APL-put.down-IA ‘We
put down our food [for you]’. When the context does not clearly bring forward that
the second person is the agent and not the object, and that the first person plural is
 211
the object and not the agent, the verb form can be preceded by a form consisting of a
second person pronoun, mi or mi-na-ha, + the suffix combination -tu-p, functioning
as an agent marker, in order to clarify that the second person is the agent:
(115)mi-tu-p ki-m-koly-aõ (1664)
 2s-AD-ABL 1pO-2sA-love-IA
 ‘You love us’.
(116)mi-na-ha-tu-pki-ha… ki-m-a-tsa…-iy-ha (1681)
 2POS-CON-PL-AD-ABL 1pPOS-field 1pO-2A-APL-3sO.see-SE-PL
 ‘You (p) saw our fields [for us]’.
7.2.5. Applicative
The first and second person object markers, the zero-marked third person singular
object, the third person plural object marker p(o)-, and the second person subject or
agent markers can be followed by the applicative marker -(h)a. The applicative
forms which are obtained when -(h)a is attached to a person marker are as follows:
1s: a- + -(h)a- > a-
2sm:m(i)-+ -(h)a- > m-a-
2sf:p(i)-+ -(h)a- > p-a-
3s: ø- + -(h)a- > ha-
1p: k(i)-+ -(h)a- > k-a-
2p: m(i)- ... -ha+ -(h)a- > m-a- ... -ha
3p: p(o)-+ -(h)a- > p-a- + PL -ha > p-a-ha
m(o)-+ -(h)a- > m-a- + PL -ha > m-a-ha
Like mo-, m-a-ha is a nasalized form, the result of a merger of *õ ‘3sO’ + p-a-ha:
(117)mu…aõ m-a-ha-tiki-aõ (2129)
 prayer 3sA.3pO-APL-PL-do-IA
 ‘he prays for them’
 Applicative -(h)a occurs with intransitive as well as transitive stems. It is
normally combined with an object marker, indicating that the event takes place to
the benefit or to the detriment of the person involved:
(118)ø-a-kot-aõ (555)
 3sS-1sO.APL-be-IA
 ‘it is for me’/ ‘I have’
212

3pPOS-house 2A-3pO-APL-PL-3sO.see-SE-PL-F-IA
‘You (p) will see their houses for them’.
However, in the case of the inversion of second person subject or agent and first
person plural object (see section 7.2.4) the applicative marker -(h)a, indicating that
the event takes place to the benefit/detriment of the object, is then not suffixed to the
object marker but to the subject or agent marker (see also the examples in section
7.2.4):
(125) mi-na-ha-tu-p ki-m-a-hia-y-ha-õ (1656)
2POS-CON-PL-AD-ABL 1pO-2S-APL-wait.for-SE-PL-IA
‘You (p) wait for us’.

son and Eggert 2001; cf. Anderson 1997b). For transitive verbs, the
s generally index the object (direct, indirect/primary, or even bene-
causee, depending on the particular stem). Subject marking is found
 rious intransitive verbs (see below), as well as some experiencer sub-
 semantically transitive verbs like ‘hear’, and optionally under the
ons of subject-affective agreement (Bashir 1985). Note that one and

nge of Brsk. verb stems obligatorily double-mark the person/class of
ject through the use of the class-marker preﬁxes and the subject
(51). According to Tikkanen (1995: 492), some volitional and most
 litional (non-active) intransitive verbs show this pattern, e.g., man
 e, (volitional)’ -mán ‘(non-volitional)’. As with the forms in (50h–j)
 class iv nouns do not trigger preﬁxal agreement. The doubly
subject construction occurs when the subject is not in “control” of
 ion described by the verb. The inanimate (or inactive) class iv
are canonically never in “control” of the action, and thus this lack
ble-marking is to be expected (52). 8
 at class iii inanimates trigger this double-marking suggests that the distribution is
mmatical or morpholexical rather than semantic in nature in present-day Brsk.

with auxiliary verbs in Brsk, at least with personal (1/2 ±pl.) or
subjects (53). 10

lluded to above, Brsk. speakers also use possessor-raising construc-
Anderson 1995, 1997), where the person of a possessor of a bound
s marked as the verb’s argument, rather than the logical semantic
 nt itself. With transitive verbs, these additionally require the causa-
nefactive/affective marker, or at least take series-C inﬂections, the
 sed with *-a- causative stems (54).

he nature of inﬂection in Brsk. auxiliary verb constructions follows several com-
 patterns, some of which have been synchronically univerbated into massive,
 marked complexes. For more on doubled and split marking in Brsk. auxiliary
structions and typologically related phenomena, see Anderson 2006.

rding to Bashir (1985: 9), the a-causative is used with active transi-
 form transitive-causative and transitive-benefactive stems. With
itve stems, all the s-causative forms in Brsk. isolated from Lorimer’s
 materials are used with verbs belonging to the “non-active” class
ontrolled motion, statives, inchoatives, etc.). Thus causative stems
 to make reference to an “active” or “non-active” categorization of
 bal semantics, and this parameter determines the selection of the
usative morphemes in HBrsk., unlike in YBrsk., where the crucial
n governing the selection of one causative morpheme over the
 ccording to Berger (1974: 29), is the presence or absence of a d- pre-
h a few lexical exceptions). 11

rb stem occupies position class 0 in the verb template. It may be a

he afﬁxes found in this position include the (aorist) participle in
und in most ﬁnite verbs and in non-ﬁnite/subordinate/relative-type
. This position also includes the optative/supine, the conditional,
 nitive, and the sufﬁxal part of the converb circumﬁx n-. . .-n (the
l part co-occupying position -3 with the d-preﬁx).
 aorist participle in Brsk. appears in all the ﬁnite verb forms except
atively infrequent Konativ (past/perfective screeve) and the present
ast/durative screeve). It appears as -m, often with an epenthetic
 u- or -i- (the latter preceding -i in the following syllable). It may be
in modiﬁcational functions as well as the ﬁnite verbal functions
 ned above. In the former function it nevertheless retains its internal
osyntax, e.g., subject/object marking in position-class -2, ergative
 igned to a transitive subject, etc. In addition to the aorist participle
position +4 is also occupied by the optative/supine in -is≥ and the
ve in -as. The optative/supine has a range of functions, primarily
 less frequently the formation of certain kinds of subordinate
predicate. The conditional—historically a complex of forms—syn-
ally occupies position +4 as well. For more on the functions of
lements, see 2.13 below.

 of the characteristic forms of Brsk. non-ﬁnite morphosyntax is the
b (or conjunctive participle) in (n-). . .-n, which comes in preﬁxal,
 , and circumﬁxal allomorphs. As mentioned above the converb pre-
 rt occupies the same position as the d-preverb/preﬁx, i.e., position
h which it is mutually exclusive. The sufﬁxal (or post-stem circum-
art of the converb occupies position class +4 in the Brsk. verb tem-
 ts function is mostly to mark same-subject clauses, temporally
 ng the following clause. Thus it is similar in function to conjunc-
rticiples in Indo-Aryan languages or converbs of various types in
(see Hapelsmath and König 1995): it primarily marks same-subject
 where the converb-marked action temporally precedes the action

 class) of the subject or object in the form of a position-class -2 ref-
arker. All d-forms lack the preﬁx n-, but the sufﬁxal element may
 present in forms bearing the n-preﬁx.

erbal form classes and verb derivation
ded to above, there are a number of different formal verb-stem
in Brsk. Verb derivation is extremely limited in Brsk. In general, any
al word can be used with the auxiliary verb et- (or man- for some in-
ves) to form an inﬂectable verb stem. Modern spoken Brsk. is ﬁlled

stem couplets, and the quasi-derivational use of the causative/
ctive/affective markers (position -1) discussed above. 13
 ther lexicalized derivational elements may have enjoyed greater productivity in
 rms of Brsk. For example, there appears to be an element -en found in various

rphological characteristics of Burushaski dialects
 not a monolithic entity, but rather exhibits some considerable re-
variation. The Brsk. spoken in the various villages throughout the
and Nagar valleys show a number of non-trivial differences but are
 most part remarkably similar. The dialect of Brsk. spoken in Yasin
(also known as Werchikwar) differs lexically, phonologically, and
ologically from the Hunza and Nagar variants. In the following
s, we outline some of the salient morphological characteristics of
 gar varieties of Brsk. as well (3.2).
unza versus Yasin morphology
Hunza versus Yasin nominal morphology
 rsk./NBrsk. and YBrsk. nominal systems differ in a number of note-
respects. First the pronoun system shows a number of particular-
example the use of mo for ‘she’ instead of in(e). Also, the ﬁrst and
 person singular pronouns no longer contrast the ergative and
ative cases. Rather than being an archaism in YBrsk., as one might
 given the well-known dictum on the nominative-accusative ten-
of ﬁrst and second person pronouns, this appears to be a second-
utralization in YBrsk. The ﬁrst person preserves the old ergative/
form, while the second person appears in the historically absolu-
 m. Note that the oblique stem for the second person singular is
 YBrsk.

Burushaski,"Brsk. lacks the rich derivational machinery characteristic of many
 sian languages (e.g., Turkic or Mongol), it nevertheless has several
tive derivational afﬁxes, as well as numerous lexical items and alter-
rms which suggest that a number of such afﬁxes were formerly used

 an alternation between the presence and lack of class marking as in

 most languages of South Asia (and Inner Asia), Brsk. utilizes a sys-

 of the most common elements used to form new modiﬁers are the
-um and -mo. In some forms, these are in free variation (32a), while
 rs, only one form may occur (32b–c). These attach to adverbs and
in various forms to create adjectives. The sufﬁx -um is particularly
 n with the ines case, i.e., -ul-um (which contrasts in meaning with
mophonous inabl [32d–e]). Finally, new adverbial forms can be cre-

bal morphology
 re two basic aspectual series (or screeves 5) of ﬁnite indicative verbal
 n Brsk, the past/perfective and non-past/durative. Each of these
s consists of a set of tense forms, both of which consist of simplex
nd forms consisting of a lexical verb in combination with an aux-
erb.
 maximal template of the Brsk. simplex verb is given by Tikkanen
91) as follow:
person-caus-÷-pl.subj-dur-1sg.subj-st-opt/cond/aux-subj.sfx-q
(÷) is optionally preceded by at most four preﬁxes, the negative
n-class -4), the mostly lexicalized preﬁx or preverb d- (-3), various
minal subject/object markers (-2), and the causative/benefactive
he stem (0) is followed by: the optional plural/distributed action
 (+1); the durative/non-past marker (+2); the ﬁrst singular subject
 (+3); the aorist participle form, the inﬁnitive, the optative, condi-
 (+4); followed by subject sufﬁxes (also the imperative markers and
uxiliary forms) (+5); and ﬁnally, the interrogative (+6). 6 A relatively
 ed form of this template represented in a single word may be seen
Note that positions +3 and +5 are mutually exclusive and hence all
ts cannot be ﬁlled in a single word.

em to fall into two basic sets of forms, the term seems appropriate in this context.

gative occupies position -4 in the Brsk. verb template, that is, the
 ost preﬁxal position (43). The negative is marked either by the pre-
HBrsk., YBrsk.) or the pro-clitic óo= (NBrsk.). The preﬁx causes de-
(and deaspiration) of a following voiced (or aspirated) obstruent,
tress shift to the syllable immediately following the negative preﬁx,
he clitic does not trigger these.

he d-preﬁx
 the noteworthy complexities of Brsk. morphology is the preﬁx d-,
appears with an epenthetic, harmonically conditioned vowel. The
x or preverb is a lexicalized, often discontinuous, part of the stem’s
entry. It occupies position -3 in the Brsk. verb template. In a small
r of cases, there are minimal pairs of verbs, one of which either lacks
 reﬁx while the other has it or has a non-alternating preﬁx without
 or class markers, while the other has an alternating preﬁx and per-
 cislocative meaning, to vaguely (de-)transitivizing functions, to ac-
 ject focus (Bashir 1985), to various indiosyncratic, sometimes
semantic nuances. Verbs with the d-preﬁx can be both transitive
 ransitive (45).

 iv) and plural as well. With 1/2 or class ii objects, the singular form is found to

 the salient characteristics of Brsk. is its highly developed system of
here are several different types of cases in Brsk., roughly, grammati-
 tivated structurally, or by verbal argument subcategorization, e.g.,
en, dat [< all]), local-directional (loc, ines, superes, all[-ii], abl
 bl], inabl, ill, superabl, superlat, ades, ades-ii, ad-lat, etc.), two
f instrumentals (the k-indstrumental and the a˜e-instrumental, the
tive (an original auxiliary noun construction, see also 1.3 below),
rious lexicalized or lexically restricted local-directional and instru-
 cases. In addition to these, a further range of local case categories
 formed by combining various case elements with so-called rela-
nouns discussed in section 1.3.
forms in Brsk. nouns attach to the oblique stem, which for all
 but class ii nouns is identical to the unmarked stem; the oblique

 different case forms of YBrsk. show an interesting patterning with
 to use in conjunctive and disjunctive constructions. Thus the erga-
 -e and the ablative in -cum appear to be used phrasally, appearing
n the rightmost (head) noun (83). The dative and genitive, on the
 and (as well as the new allative), appear on both nouns in the con-
or disjoined noun phrase (84).

omplex sentences in HBrsk. with predicates in the two clauses of
 g valency, the case form of the subject noun depends on which
 e it belongs to structurally. Thus, the subject may appear in either
minative/unmarked form or the ergative, depending on the internal
uency of the individual clauses.

Hunza versus Yasin verbal morphology
the salient characteristics of YBrsk. verb morphology is the redu-
d repetitive/habitual. This is used with the past form of the auxiliary
a)-.
 l-a du-ƒares-i ke: un ak}ita jo-j ≥ o≥ ba-m, un a-íc-a-a? seni

 e asked the fox, “You came here again and again; didn’t you see
anything?”’ (Berger 1974: 104)
 class iv form of the copular verb ‘be’ in YBrsk. is dua corresponding
sk. bila (~ dila in older forms) and NBrsk. dila (Berger 1998: 129).
 (.past) is bum in YBrsk. but bom in HBrsk.
Brsk., the Konativ past (the one which lacks the aorist participle and
arked instead) is used commonly in YBrsk.
 sen-e hir park-ule del-u
rl-erg man park-loc hit-ii
he girl hit the man in the park’(Anderson et al. 1998)
the form in (88).
 conditional appears as a present/durative participial form with
 rticle ceq. The conditional participle appears in three forms,
 m (/-c-) -am (1sg) -an (1pl) and -um (everything else).
am ceq ecan ceq
um ceq ecum ceq
um ceq ecum ceq
um ceq ecum ceq
um ceq ecum ceq
um ceq ecum ceq (Berger 1974: 48)
e the use of ke as a complementizer in YBrsk. where one might ex-
 se. Its form and position in the clause are suggestive that this may
a borrowing from a local Indo-European language.

 e asked them, “Whose bread do you eat?”’ (Berger 1974: 106)
 of the noteworthy aspects of Brsk. morphosyntax in general, and
 k. in particular, is the complex set of factors which interact to de-
e the nature of verb agreement, combining (hierarchical/linear)
 ic, semantic, and discourse factors (Anderson and Eggert 2001). As
ed previously, Brsk. verbs agree with their subject and object. When
ated noun phrases occur, case marking is either found only on the
 r rightmost) conjunct or on both, depending on the particular case.
 conjunctive or disjunctive objects are found, object agreement
 the closest conjunct. When conjoined subjects are used, agreement
ys plural. When disjunctive subject-NP constructions are encoun-
 n the other hand, agreement with the nearest subject is found with
 redicates, while with others, a semantically driven, global agree-
 .e., plural subject marking) is found. For examples, see (90g–m).

unza versus Nagar morphology
lly speaking, the varieties of Brsk. spoken in communities through-
Hunza and Nagar valleys differ only slightly from each other. To be
range of phonological and lexical features characteristic of each re-
ve been adduced (see Anderson 1997a for more on the comparative
 ogy of Brsk. dialects). However, various morphophonological, mor-
ical, and morphosyntactic characteristics typical of one or another
ialect can be enumerated. In terms of morphophonology, NBrsk.
s assimilatory phenomena observable within alternations between
r and plural stems, e.g., from -´lcin ‘eye’ one ﬁnds -´lci-muc in
 rather than -´lcu-muc as in HBrsk. (Berger 1998: 51).
 e of the obvious differences between NBrsk. and HBrsk. in terms of
al morphology are the variant plural forms of certain individual lex-
ound. For example, with certain monosyllabic noun stems, NBrsk.
 to preserve an older plural form with a single marker of plurality,
 Brsk. has innovated a double-marked plural formation:

Chapter 2 Morpho-syntax
2.1 Constituent order Typology
Burushaski is a S(ubject)-O(bject)-V(erb) language. Thus, the verb occurs in the sentence final
position. The (S)OV word order is also reflected in other constituents orders. Thus, the
language is postpositional, and not prepositional in terms of word order. The noun follows the
relative clause (RelN). The nouns follow adjectives (AN) and the Genitive (GN). These
constituent orders make Burushaski a “hea final language”. This ten en y is very regular in
Burushaski with a very few exceptions. Let us look at the constituent order in the following
sentences:
2.1.1 Main Clause (S)OV
(1) Intransitive Sentence:
hiles gu ʰar-imi
boy walk-3MSG
‘The boy walke ’
(2) Transitive Sentence:
ǰa-akitapi-riin-ar i-čʰiy-am
1SG-ERG book[-h,II]3MSG-hand-DAT 3MSG-give-1SG
‘I gave the book into his han ’.
2.1.2 Adpositional Phrase (Postpositional Phrase)
The word order in an Adpositional Phrase is also head-final. Consider (3) for illustration:
11
(3) Postpositional Phrase
a) raanuma altit um baltit-a-r ziboon-mo kaa gu ʰar-umo
raanuma bltit from baltit-GEN-DAT ziboon-F.GEN withwalk-3F
‘Rahnuma walke from Altit to Baltit with Ziboon’
b) inhaal-a-r mu-ulus-ekaa nimo
3F home-GEN-DAT 3F-brother-GEN withgo-3F
‘She went to the house with her brother’
2.1.3 Adjectives and Noun (AN)
Adjectives precede the qualified Noun in Burushaski. Consider (4) for illustration:
(4) a) altasgiyaas-an
beautiful baby-SG.IND
‘A beautiful baby’
b) burumbalas-an
white bird-SG.IND
‘A white bir ’
2.1.4 Possessor Noun (GN)
The Possessor noun, which takes the Genitive case, precedes the Possessed noun. Consider
examples in (5) for illustration:
(5) a. hurmat-e oʂ um
hurmat-GEN waist band
‘The waist ban of Hurmat’ or ‘Hurmat’s waist ban ’
12
2.2 Typology of the Verb Component
The inflected verb occurs mostly in the final position of the sentence. The inflected verb carries
information for Person, Number, and Gender of the Noun Phrase arguments in the sentence. It
also carries the information about (Tense and) Aspect. The template for a highly inflected
Burushaski verb is given in (6) below:
(6) NEG-D.prefix-Object/Subject-TRASITIVE-root-Subject/Number/Gender-Q
a- -ugu-s- aal-umuw-a//
[a-t-uku-s-tal-umuw-a]
‘NEG-D.prefix-2SG-TR-wake-3F-Q’
‘Di n’t she wake you?
The verb root is optionally preceded by four prefixes, the negative prefix, the pre-verb prefix d-
, and followed by subject suffix, various pronominal subject or object markers, transitive
maker. The root is followed by subject and number suffix, and question marker. The inflected
verb consists of a verb stem which contains a verb root and information on Aspect. Below we
will look at the morpho-syntax of intransitive verbs with and without a pronominal prefix
(section 2.2.1), auxiliary verb (section 2.2.2), and transitive verb (section 2.2.3).
2.2.1 Intransitive Clause (with or without pronominal prefix)
(7) Intransitive Verb with pronominal prefix
 a) ine hiles i-waal-imi
 DEM boy3SG-lost-3SG
‘That boy lost’
13
 b) uwe hilešou-waal-uman
 DEM boy.PL 3PL-lost-3PL
‘Those boys lost’
(8) Intransitive verb without pronominal prefix
a) in gu ʰar-imi
3Mwalk-3M
‘He walke ’
The inflected verb stem [-wal-] ‘lose’ in senten es (7) a & b above possesses a pronominal
prefix agreeing with the Absolutive NP whereas the inflected verb stem [gu ʰar-] in sentence
(8) a & b does not.
2.2.2 Auxiliary Verb
The auxiliary verb always follows the main verb with no syntactic material between them. The
ungrammatical sentence (9b) (with an asterisk “*” mark) illustrates that the main verb and
auxiliary verb form a syntactic component.
(9) Word order with Auxiliary verb
a) in-eguncsabaq ɣatay bay
3M-ERG every.day lessonread.IPFV be.PRES.3M
‘He is reading lesson every day.’
* in-e guncɣatay sabaq bo
3F-ERG every.day read.IPFV lessonbe.PRES.3F
14
2.2.3 Transitive Verb
The mono-transitive inflected verb in sentence (10a) below consists of a verb stem and a suffix
which agrees with the subject and a pronominal prefix agreeing with object. But, the sentence
(10b) does not have a pronominal prefix. The presence/absence of pronominal prefix is
determined by the [+/- animacy] feature of the NP.
(10) Transitive sentence
 a) in-ehilesi- el-umo
3SG-ERG boy3MSG-hit-3FSG
 ‘She hit the boy’
 b) in-emu-riinel-umo
3SG-ERG 3F-handhit-3FSG
‘She hurt her han ’
2.3 Noun Phrase
The noun phrase in Burushaski consists minimally of a noun and optional modifiers preceding
the head noun schematically represented as follows (The elements within the parentheses are
optional):
(Dem/Relative pronoun/Possessor Pronoun/Quantifiers) (Modifiers) (Adjective(s)){Noun}
Consider examples for illustration in (11) Demonstrative and Noun, (12) Possessor Pronoun
and Noun (13) Quantifier and Noun to (14) Adjective below:
 15
(11) amin hiles
 which boy
 ‘Whi h boy’
(12) in-elaqpis

 ‘His han ker hief’
(13) hin hiles-an
 one boy-SG.IND
 ‘One boy’
(14) matum buš-an
 black cat-SG.IND
 ‘A bla k at’
Based on the examples in (11) to (14) above, a generalized structure for the Burushaski Noun
Phrase can be given as:
(Specifier)-(Adverb)-(Adjective)-Noun
(A) khine hin but altas asinan
DEM one very beautiful girl
‘This is one beautiful girl’
16
2.4 Postpositions
Burushaski postpositions represent a large class of words which functions like English
prepositions but they follow rather than precede the object NP. There are different kinds of
postpositions in Burushaski: locational, temporal, other postpositions, and postpositions with
pronominal prefixes.
2.4.1 Locational Postpositions
Table 2.1 gives the list of location postpositions in Burushaski. Examples in sentences (15-21)
illustrate the use of postpositions in the list respectively.

3.1.2.2 D-Prefix Verbs
D-prefix is a pre-verbal prefix; the function of this prefix is not clear. The verbs with d-prefix
have been called d-prefix verbs in the literature. Some examples of -prefix verbs are: [ -i-
man-imi], ‘(it) be ame rea y’, [ -i-r-imi] ‘(it) ooke ’, [ -i-tal-imi] ‘he woke’. Examples (92),
(93), and (94) below provide the use of d-prefix verbs in sentences:
(92) -i-man-imi ‘he was born’
a) hiles-an -i-man-imi
boy-SG.IND x-3-become-3
‘A boy was born.’
(93) -i-r-imi ‘it ooke ’
 a) aalu ši-ulo-i-r-imi

 ‘Potato ooke in the hearth’
 b) ǰa-aa-riinši-ce -i-r-imi

 ‘My han burnt with the hearth’
(94)[ -i-tal-imi] ‘he woke up’
a) giyaas -i-tal-imi
baby x-i-woke-3
‘Baby woke up’

3.1.2.3 Causatives
Burushaski has morphological causatives. There are three strategies to form causative
construction on inflected verb: 1) [s-] prefix insertion on unaccusative verbs 2) [∅-] prefix
insertion on unergative verbs 3) lengthening of object prefix vowel or vowel lengthening
on transitive verbs. Formation of the causative constructions involves an increase the valency
of the verb. The causative voice is applied to a verb and its valency increases by one. For
example if the original verb is intransitive the causative becomes transitive or if the original
verb is transitive the causative verb becomes di-transitive. Many causative verbs in Burushaski
are formed by adding a pronominal prefix to the verb. Consider (95) below where the new
participant is the subject (Agent) of the causative construction and the old subject of the (non-
causative form of the) verb (intransitive) is demoted to be the direct object. The subject marker
[-mo] ‘3FSG’ of the inflected intransitive verb ‘gučʰa-mo’ in suffix position now occupies the
position of the pronominal prefix in the derived (causative) form ‘mo-guča-mi’ ‘he put her to
sleep’ Consider (95a&b) below.
(95)Intransitive verb changes into transitive (-∅ prefix strategy)
a) sabrinagučʰa-mo
sabrina sleep-3FSG
‘Sabrinaslept’
b) saliim-e sabrinamo-guča-mi
saliim-ERGsabrina3FSG-sleep-3MSG
‘Saleem put ause Sabrina to sleep’
 68
In the example (96) below the underlying verb stem /-s-man- ‘make’ is transitive and the
causative form is di-transitive. The agent of the sentence (96-a) is demoted to direct object. On
the derived verb the position of the subject marker on the underlying verb demotes from the
suffix to the pronominal prefix position and the vowel coalescence on the derived verb
lengthens the vowel. The verb stem remains the same. -umu-e-s-man-imi/ be omes -umo-
o-s-man-imi//.
(96)Transitive verb changes into di-transitive (vowel lengthening)
a) sabrina-a keek -e-s-man-umo
 sabrina-ERG cakex-3cake-TR-make-3F
‘Sabrina ma e the ake’
b) karim-e sabrina keek-umo-o-s-man-imi
karim-ERGsabrina cake x-3F-3cake-TR-make-3MSG
‘Karim ause Sabrina to make the ake.
If the verb is intransitive, the causative construction is formed by [s-] prefix insertion. Consider
example (97) below.
(97)Intransitive verb (s-) prefix insertion
 a) hiles i-war-imi
boy 3SG-tired-3SG
‘The boy is tire ’
 b) ǰa-a hiles e-s-par-am
1SG-ERGboy 3SG-CAUS-tired-1SG
‘I ma e the boy tire ’
69
3.1.2.4 Negatives
In HB negation is formed by adding a prefix [a-] ‘NEG’ before the infle te verb. Consider
examples (98), (99), (100) and (101) below for illustration:
(98)Negation of verb [galimi] ‘break-3SG’
a) gilaas a-kal-imi
glass NEG-break-3SG
‘The glass i not break’
(99)Negation of verb [a-s-imi] ‘he tol me’. We an see in the examples below that a gli e
[y] is inserted between two vowels to avoid hiatus.
a) in-e ǰa-a-ra-s-imi
3SG-ERG 1SG-GEN-DAT 1SG-say-3SG
‘He told him’
b) in-e ǰa-a-ray-a-s-imi
3SG-ERG 1SG-GEN-DAT NEG-3MSG-say-1SG
‘I i not tell him’
(100) Negation of verb [ʂi] ‘eat’
a) ʂapikee-ʂi
bread NEG-eat
‘Don’t eat brea ’
(101) Negation of verb [min-e] ‘ rink it’
a)ʰil oo-min
water NEG-drink
‘Dont rink water’
 70
3.1.2.5 Imperative Mood
Imperative in Burushaski is expressed with non-inflected verb. Example (102) expresses direct
command.
(102) Direct commands
a) kʰol-arʐu
here-DATcome
‘Come here’
b) el-arni
there-DAT go
‘Go there’
c) huru
‘sit’
A suffix [-in] is added for politeness or for plural forms. Thus, example (103) expresses a
polite request or command; the addressee NP is in the plural form here.
(103) Polite request
a) ma kʰolar ʐu-in
2PL herecome-PL
‘Come here please’
b) ma elarni-in
2PL there go-PL
‘Go there you.PL’
 71
3.1.2.6 Conjunctive Participle
Conjun tive parti iple ‘n- -n’ appears in HB in the form of prefix, suffix and/or circumfix
which is attached to verb stem. This conjunctive participle or co-verb performs many
grammatical functions. Examples (104), (105), and (106) below illustrate different grammatical
functions. In (104) below, The conjunctive participle expresses the temporal sequence of action.
The action expressed by the conjunctive participle comes before the action of the matrix clause.
(104) Sequential Action
 je bazaar-ar n-aa-n kitaap-ann-u-kan-i-n

Burushaski," Chapter 8 – Syntax: This chapter is quite important and dealt with syntax and
morphosyntax together. After examining the basic constituent order in phrases ands)
clauses, I discussed grammatical relations and agreement systems. In sum, Burushaski ie
verbs govern the cases of core arguments in an ergative alignment, while some verbs
show agreement of a personal suffix according to the subject argument, not the
Stud
absolutive one as ergative languages generally do. Moreover, the personal prefix on
verbs agrees with the argument in the undergoer role. Interrogative clauses and syntactic
modal expressions basically do not change constituent order but informational
 ign
Fo
operations such as topicalization affects the order to make the target salient in context.
re
To topicalize a constituent it is moved forwards. Burushaski has several converbal
forms that are used to combine clauses as well as conjunctives. These forms may be in
of
the process of changing their functions from same-subject conjunctions (as described in
Tikkanen (1995)) to free-subject ones, or of getting looser functions with regard to
switch-reference.

8.2.2. Core argument
 ok
 What I call the core argument is simply the nominal unit whose syntagm fulfills
 yo
any grammatical slot being required by a predicate. A grammatical slot of predicates
must contains a core argument, and a core argument must be in such a slot. Core
 (T
arguments include not only nominal phrases, but also nominalised clauses as
complement clauses.
 sis
 Every core argument works as a subject, an agent, or an object for the dominant
he
predicate, including a complement for the copular predicate, in the same clause. The
description about the basic constituent orders, which will be in §‎8.3, is based on the
 al
core argument and the predicate syntagms.

Chapter 8 – Syntax Here, after examining the basic constituent order in phrases
and clauses, I discussed grammatical relations and agreement systems. In sum, Eastern
Burushaski verbs govern the cases of core arguments in an ergative alignment, while
some verbs show agreement of a personal suffix according to the subject argument, not
 s)
the absolutive one. Moreover, the personal prefix on verbs agrees with the argument in
 ie
the undergoer role. Eastern Burushaski has several converbal forms that are used toSt
combine clauses as well as conjunctives. These forms may be in the process of changing ud
their functions from same-subject conjunctions to free-subject ones, or of getting looser
functions with regard to switch-reference.ign
Part II – Theoretical Issues Fo
 re
Chapter 9 – Transitivity and Its Surroundings I discussed mainly intransitive
stem pairs and transitive stem pairs; each type of pairs shows a gap in the personal
 of
prefix slot. Significantly, previous studies did not examine why transitive stem pairs are
y
differentiated from each other. Therefore, I examined the issue myself and concluded
rs
that the employment of the prefix slot on a transitive stem is motivated by the likelihood
 it
of the presence of an object argument. This likelihood is relative to nominal properties
Un
such as nominal class and definiteness.
ive
 Chapter 10 – d- Derivation I examined the system of verb stem derivations with
the d- prefix. d- remains a controversial prefix. I discussed the meaning and functions of
 ok
the prefix in this chapter and listed five functions—venitive, fientive, stative, resultative,
 yo
and anticausative—with a directional suggestion of grammaticalization. These functions
 (T
are realised according to the meaning of verbal bases. All these functions involve a goal
point of action and therefore share telic characteristics.
 sis
 Chapter 11 – Definiteness and Specificity In this chapter, I researched the
he
indefinite markers -an and -ik and surveyed the morphosyntactic and pragmatic
 al
relationship among nominal characteristics on the basis of the database of a text. These
T
indefinite markers are often used in non-specifically interpreted situations and in
 or negative clauses. Speakers choose grammatical roles for referents in utterances on the
basis of definiteness and specificity, and it can be said that these properties affect
 ct syntactic expressions.

 Comparing with the total avarage, Agent arguments are clustered on the left side in

Table 144, while Object ones are relatively gathered on the right side. Bare forms can

11.4.3. How far or where is an argument situated from the predicate?
 yo
 Besides the shape and information flow, grammatical roles are associated with the
position of arguments in clauses. This can be summarized as so-called basic constituent
 (T
order, which is described as SV/AOV in Burushaski as mentioned in §8‎ .3. It can be
simply illustrated by the average distance of all the arguments of each role as shown in
sis
Table 145. The arguments labelled with “Copular” are subject or complement arguments
in copular clauses, and “Locatives” are spacial peripheral arguments in all kinds of
he
clauses. The scale of distance is based on word number, and when an argument
 al immediately precedes the predicate, then its distance counts 1. Arguments stated after

object and verb. It is, however, not a necessary order since syntactic
relations are sufficiently indicated by suffixes. Word order is only
important in distinguishing the functions of certain modifiers.
That is, the distinction between adjective and adverb depends upon
the position of the form in question. If the modifier stands between

a noun andits formal suffix, it has adjectival function; if it stands
directly before a verb, it has adverbial function. Examples:

4.2 Grammatical Functions
Grammatical functions like subject and object constitute a different kind of syntax not
wholly congruent with phrase structure (indeed in some theories a completely different domain
of grammar). As one kind of test of grammatical functions, agreement in Tonkawa largely
concerns the categories of person and number on verbal predicates, since modifier nominals
(‘adjectives’), adpositions and other parts of speech do not participate in any kind of agreement
process. However, even with verbs, agreement is by no means a straight-forward test of
grammatical functions, as many grammatical paradigms (e.g. the evidential) do not change for
person or number or other nominal categories. A more serious problem is that there exist
numerous verbs in which object morphology is used where its English translation would
naturally be translated with an English subject (Hoijer 1933: 70):
(n) kaʔacoʔkewʔacoʔ
ke-ʔace-we-ʔeke-we-ʔace-we-ʔe
1OBJ-be.ill-DECL-PRES1OBJ-OBJ.PL-BE.ILL-DECL-PRES
‘I’m sick’ ‘We’re sick’
ʔace·weʔ waʔace·weʔ
ʔace-·-we-ʔe we-ʔace-·-we-ʔe
be.ill-2OBJ-DECL-PRESOBJ.PL-be.ill-2OBJ-DECL-PRES
‘You’re sick’‘Y’all’re sick’
ʔacoʔwaʔacoʔ
ʔace-we-ʔe we-ʔace-we-ʔe
be.ill-DECL-PRES OBJ.PL-be.ill-DECL-PRES
‘He’s sick’‘They’re sick’
In some cases, such object-oriented predicates can take either subject or object morphology
depending on interpretation:
(n) a. hecnoʔs b. kecnoʔ
 he-cane-we-ʔe-s k-e-cane-we-ʔe
 REFL-lie.down-DECL-PRES-1 1OBJ-REFL-lie.down-DECL-PRES
 ‘I lie down (willingly)’‘I fall over’
As such, Tonkawa appears to have had a Fluid-S alignment in which different classes of
intransitive predicates pattern either like transitive subjects or transitive objects, depending on
their semantic interpretation. Without native speaker judgments, it is difficult to go beyond this
to make formal tests for grammatical function changing.
4.3 Relative clauses
If one defines a relative clause in a Eurocentric way, with an external head and relative
pronoun coreferential with it, then Tonkawa does not have relative clauses. However, defined
semantically as a clause with a head noun whose extension is restricted in some way by a
proposition, then relative constructions are rife. This is because although Tonkawa does not have
full subordinate relative clauses, nominals can be modified by participial constructions that have
the same functional role as European-style subordinate relative clauses. For example, in (n), the
participial phrase xa·xakla ‘who arrived’ modifies the subject wixwanwa·ʔa·la ‘the Little One’ (a
trickster folk-hero):
(n) wixwan-wa·-ʔa·-la[xa·-xa-k-la]

“ha-kla-na-t panxo-w,” no-k-laknoʔo.
move.SG-down-ABL-SS.CONS bathe-IMP say-PART-EVID
‘The Little One who arrived said: ‘Go down and bathe.’’ (TT 17.11)
Though this might be the most canonical form of relative clause, most participial forms in the
available texts serve other functions. (n) for example represents a locative adjunct ‘toward
where the woman was lying’, and in (n), a phrase that at first appears to be a preposed relative
clause in fact is an accusative absolute ‘as one settling down in a big camp’:
(n) ʔe·-kla Hacsokonay-laha-cxo-t waʔasay-ʔa·-wʔan

‘A young Tonkawa man who was settling down in a big camp
was making arrows.’ (TT 27.1)
It is probable that some participial constructions either originated as, or with the last speakers
were, biclausal, with a higher preposed question word and a subordinate participial form, as in
(n):
(n) “hete-caya-mka-·-k-yena·ya-k?”
what-placeTH-call-2OBJ-PART-INTER2SG-ACC
‘Where is it that they called you?’ (TT 3.3)
In some cases, participial forms with null heads serve effectively as finite forms, as with (n)
where ka·lwa·nasek ‘[It is I] who am going off to gamble’ with no overt main clause head:
(n) taxso·-k-laʔacxo·ne·-wʔan ka·lw-a·-na-se-k,”
be.dawn-PART-NOM.SGnorth-ADESSgamble-move.SG-ABL-1-PART
‘I’m going up north to gamble tomorrow.’ (TT 4.16)
Another finite-like verb form that relies on participial morphology is the resultative, as in (n):

Tonkawa,"Syntax
Tonkawa constitutes a fairly standard example of nonconfigurational syntax, in that
syntactic constituents of clauses, as well as any constituents of noun phrases, may surface in any
order. There is remarkably little evidence for syntactic asymmetries below the level of the
clause. To begin with, transitive sentences with overt arguments are rare, and most permutations
of basic word order appear in the corpus:

In general, Tonkawa syntax represents a mix of right- and left-branching phrasal structures.

4.1 Phrase structure
Determining phrase structure asymmetries in extinct languages, without native speaker
judgments, can be challenging. The reason is that many of the tests that one would use to
determine headedness in other languages are lacking or liminal in Tonkawa. For example,
determiners like definiteness or obviation markers which in English and other languages are free
standing words in Tonkawa are fairly rigidly suffixed. Likewise, as discussed in §3.5,
predicational modifiers also very freely incorporate into the nominal phrase. When nominal
nongenitival modifiers surface outside this morphological matrix, they may surface either before
or after the modified substantive (n)-(n), though they usually occur after:

Tonkawa," In earlier literature (e.g. Hoijer 1933) -wa· was identified as meaning ‘aforementioned’,
but this is problematic in two senses. First, definiteness and -wa· can be marked independently
of each other, as in (na-d) with the implication that, although all aforementioned arguments are
identifiable, some arguments marked with -wa· nonetheless are not marked for definiteness:
(n) a. No definite marking, no obviative marking

 ‘The young man filled his pipe.’ (TT 21.7)
These two categories are thus morphologically and referentially independent of each other.
Another problem with assigning the status of ‘aforementioned’ to what we are calling an
obviative suffix is that there are actually instances of -wa·- which have not been mentioned prior
in a text. For example, in TT 4.2, the first mention of the woman in the story is marked
kwa·nwa·ʔa·la, which is unexpected if this suffix marks only the given information. Another
problem is that many aforementioned NPs are not marked with -wa· -- e.g. TT.XX, TT.XX,
TT.XX, etc. This suffix is thus not even weakly associated with ‘aforementionedness’. [See §5
for more discussion.].
3.2Verbal Morphology
 By far the most complicated part of Tonkawa morphology consists in the structure of
verbs. Verbs inflect for the person and number of both subjects and objects, but the features of
these categories are distributed across verb forms in different places in different paradigms. Like
pronouns, verbal subjects indicate singular, dual and plural numbers; verbal objects only
distinguish singular and plural. In terms of order, in most cases, the verbal stem is followed by
any negation, which is followed by any future marking, which is in turn followed by dual or
plural marking of subjects.

3.2.1 Finite verb forms
The most basic modality of verbs is that of declarative verbs, used to make statements
about actions or states of being. Declarative verbs are overtly marked with a suffix –we which is
however frequently absorbed by surrounding suffixes because of the rule of conflation (see
§2.3). Likewise tense suffixes sometimes display distinctions for person. Hoijer 1933 describes
Tonkawa as having four tenses, but in fact this is a mischaracterization: morphologically
speaking, Tonkawa has two tenses, present (-ʔe) and past (-ʔe·/ʔei/ʔe), and the use of the future
suffix –a·tewa with these two tenses renders near future and remote future readings, respectively.
Morphologically, however, these future forms are no more distinct tenses than English’s modal
auxiliary will creates a future tense in English; ‘future’ might thus better be rendered as a kind of
‘prospective’ aspect. On top of this, each ‘tense’ can be marked for continuous aspect, resulting
in eight possible tense-aspect readings:

Finally, Tonkawa also indicates the person and number of objects in the first and second person,
and the number of objects in the third person:
Table 3.9 Object agreement

2-V·- we-…-V·-
3Ø we-
Unlike subject markers, object markers never vary for tense or modality, and also unlike subject
markers, object markers are not found in dedicated templatic slots. The first person object prefix
ke- for example is found before any reflexive, causative or thematic prefix, generally at the
beginning of the word; the we- object pluralizer will be found immediately after ke-:

‘One turkey said: ‘He’s going to finish us all off!’ (TT 10.5)
The only exception when ke- does not stand immediately at the beginning of a word is when the
agreement marker is stranded in between two verb roots compounded together, as in (n) and (n):
(n) ʔe·-klaʔawas-ayon-wa·-ʔa·-la “ya-mʔacx-ante·l

watch-1OBJ-miss-NEG-IMP say-PART-EVID
‘‘Don’t lose sight of me,’ [the alligator] said.’ (TT 7.6)
Second person objects, however are marked only by the insertion of an extra mora and are found
immediately after the future suffix –a·tewa- in positive polarity forms, or immediately preceding
the negative suffix in negative polarity forms:
(n) a. [yaca·tonoʔs]
yac-a·tewa-no-we-ʔe-s
see-FUT-CONT-DECL-PRES-1.SUBJ
‘I will be seeing him.’
b. [yacatewa·noʔs]

yac-ap-·-a·tewa-no-we-ʔe-s
see-NEG-2.OBJ-FUT-CONT-DECL-PRES-1.SUBJ
‘I won’t be seeing you.’
Because the rule of conflation is sensitive to the moraic quantity of the vowels it applies to, the
insertion of this extra mora has the effect of bleeding this rule. Even more interestingly, when
the second person object agreement moves forward in the verb form to be after the negator, the
conflation rule affecting the future suffix goes into effect as usual. Second person object
agreement thus poses an interesting rare example of morphology which is not only mobile (itself
a grammatical rarum) but whose effect interacts with phonology to create dissimilar surface
paradigms.
3.2.2 Modality
Tonkawa features a rather rich array of modal paradigms expressing a variety of different
kinds of epistemic and deontic modal readings: interrogative, assertive, deontic, intentive,
jussive, imperative, and mirative. Some paradigms, such as the interrogative and imperative,
exist only in certain person-number combinations, while others have full paradigms, such as the
assertive. Some moods exist in multiple tenses and aspects (e.g. the interrogative), while others
are morphologically tenseless (e.g. the imperative). Although all of these are more marked than
the declarative in the sense that they are more infrequent in texts, from a morphological
perspective they usually have the same amount of morphological expression: an overt modal
affix plus one or more person-number affixes specific to that mood.

Tonkawa,"Tonkawa also has morphology that reduces valence. By far the most frequent is the
reflexive affix he-, which comes in the slot immediately before the verb root, unless the verb root
has been reduplicated:

Kusunda,"Syntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, with alternative

area. Subject NPs are often deleted in running discourse, the person and number of the

the verb. In terms of grammatical case marking, Kusunda follows a nominative–accusative
case marking alignment – something unusual for the languages of the region.

it is either contrastively marked, or it serves as an anchor, say, for an earlier question:
 (256)tsi t -a -an
I 1-go-IRR
‘I’ll go.’ (I’m volunteering)
‘I’ll go.’ (That’s what I’ll do)
 In general, however, more topical elements occur early and less topical ones later.
(The order in (256), then, is also a basic, unmarked order.) This is relevant to clauses
that have peripheral elements like time or location. Peripheral elements tend to attract the
focus of assertion. Thus, in (257a–c) the peripheral elements, time, place, and comitative,
occur closer to the verb than the pronominal referent. This is the least marked order:
 (257)a. tsi pyanats-˙g-˙n
 Iyesterday 1-go-REAL
 ‘I went yesterday.’
b. tsi da≥t -a -an
 I Dang 1-go-IRR
 ‘I will go to Dang.’
c. gina tok-ma u-g-i
 he/she us-WITH come-3-PAST
 ‘He/she came with us.’
 Where both peripheral elements occur – time and location – the element with closer
semantic ties to the verb occurs next to the verb, and the other element occurs as an
adverbial specification to the whole predication. This order mirrors the basic order for
transitive predications too – the object occurs next to the verb, and temporal elements
which occur outside the case frame also occur syntactically outside:
 (258)a. INTRANSITIVE:
 goraq tsi da≥ t -a -an
 tomorrowI Dang 1-go-IRR
 ‘Tomorrow I will go to Dang.’
b. TRANSITIVE:
 pyana tsi agai-da pumba-d-i
 yesterday I dog-ACC beat-1-PAST
 ‘Yesterday I beat the dog.’
 • Case marking. Case marking in Kusunda follows a basic nominative–accusative
alignment – S and A arguments are unmarked (nominative) and the O argument is
marked by the accusative suffix -da (see example (258b)). For more details and
examples, see §5.2.2.2.

Kusunda,"However, though there are no morphological differences between transitive and
intransitive Class I verbs, there are minor differences between transitive and intransitive
Class II verbs. Thus, in terms of morphological differences, the Class I–Class II
distinction is primary, and the transitive–intransitive distinction is secondary. The differ-
ences between Class II transitive and Class II intransitive verbs lie in person marking
patterns, as shown in Figure 2:

6.2.1 Intransitive suffixing pattern 1
In the most basic pattern, Class II intransitive verbs are bereft of person marking –
the suffix -ßn shown in Figure 1 is a realis marker; there is no person marker. The
distinction between persons lies only in the free pronoun:
(251) a. FIRST PERSON:b. SECOND PERSON:
tsi sip-ßnnu sip-ßn
Ienter-REAL you enter-REAL
‘I entered.’‘You entered.’
(252) a. FIRST PERSON:b. SECOND PERSON:
tsi b˙l-ßnnu b˙l-ßn
Idescend-REAL you descend-REAL
‘I descended.’‘You descended.’
6.2.2 Intransitive suffixing pattern 2
In what was probably a later, secondary development, person marking distinctions
developed in these ambiguous cases, analagous to the distinctions found elsewhere in
the grammar. As we have already seen in example (146), a pronominal marker, very
nearly a copy of the free pronoun, is suffixed to the root, immediately before the realis
marker, as in:
(253) a. FIRST PERSON:
tsi sip-tsi-n
I enter-1-REAL
‘I entered.’
b. SECOND PERSON:
nu sip-ni-n
you enter-2-REAL
‘You entered.’
94
 Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
6.2.3Suffixing pattern 3
 In yet another development, a full copy of the free pronoun is tacked on to the end of
the verb complex, following the realis marker, as in:
 (254)a. FIRST PERSON:
tsi sip-ßn-tsi
I enter-REAL-1
‘I entered.’
b. SECOND PERSON:
nu sip-ßn-nu
you enter-REAL-2
‘You entered.’
 • Pattern 3 in transitive verbs. The suffixing pattern described in §6.2.3 is also
available to Class II transitive verbs, as in the following:
 (255)a. TRANSITIVE FIRST PERSON:
tsi hul˙-d-ßn-tsi
I cook-1-REAL-1
‘I cooked it.’
b. TRANSITIVE SECOND PERSON:
nu hul˙-n-ßn-nu
you cook-2-REAL-2
‘You cooked it.’
 The triple -n-ßn-n in (255b), though morphologically accurate, is a bit of phonological
fiction. Except in very carefully articulated speech, hul˙-d-ßn and hul˙-n-ßn (the basic
forms) are pronounced identically – as hul˙-d-ßn – giving rise to the need for disambiguation.
This is true of all second person forms in Class II transitive verbs: pumba-n-ßn ‘You hit
him’; d~aba-n-ßn ‘You found it’; m˙b˙-n-ßn ‘You heard it’; unda-n-ßn ‘You showed it,’ etc.
Except in careful speech, all are pronounced with a -d.3 1
6.2.4Bitransitive verbs
 The only convincing bitransitive verb in Kusunda is the verb ‘to give,’ with all other
bitransitive notions being benefactive constructions that utilize the verb ‘to give.’
Morphologically, the verb ‘give’ is identical to Class II transitive verbs (see Figure 1),
the only exception being the verb root itself.
6.3 Clausal syntax
 Syntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, the verb coming last.
This order is typologically pervasive throughout South Asia. In Kusunda, because the
person and number of the subject (S or A) referent is marked in the verb, the subject NP,
even as a pronominal form, is usually elided. This is in keeping with universal expectations
that in unmarked clauses, the subject is usually excluded from the scope of assertion
(Givón 1984, 1991). Where the subject NP does occur, especially in connected speech,
31
We have not recorded “suffixing pattern 3” (§6.2.3) for all these verbs, though they may exist.
This needs further verification.

In fact, like many languages of the region, the same morpheme that marks accusative
also marks “dative recipient” in bitransitive clauses and the subject in “dative subject”
clauses. The grammatical category, then, marks the “terminus” of a causal chain, and
might be better termed an “endpoint.” Following are examples of both:
(114) DATIVE RECIPIENT:
a. gina-Ø t˙n-da haq t˙mb˙-g-˙n
 he-NOM I-DAT letter send-3-REAL
 ‘He sent me a letter.’
DATIVE SUBJECT:
b. t˙n-da ida≥kæaÚ u
 I-DAT hunger is:not
 ‘I am not hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is not to me’)
c. t˙n-da tsya ts-oˆ -˙n ola≥ ota≥
 I-DAT tea 1-drink-REAL tasty seems
 ‘To me drinking tea is tasty.’
Note that the verb form in (114a) is identical to the form in (113d) even though one
functions in a transitive clause and the other in a bitransitive clause. (114a) adds a
“secondary object” letter, and -da marks the animate “primary object,” a notional
indirect object (Dryer 1986).

Kusunda,"Prefixing patterns (Class I)
 Verbs are marked for the person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or
plural) of the subject argument. There is no object agreement. Person and number are
separate indices. Class I verbs are defined as those in which person is marked by
prefixes and number is marked by suffixes.

930. Subjects and Objects
These two unitswill be discus sed together because their
syntactic rnakeup (that of a noun phrase) is for the rnost part
identical. There is strong evidence that they are separate units
since k?, a norninalparticle, is used only for objects (see 934
below). Otherwise what is valid for subjects is also valid for
objects.
 931. Subjectsand objects can consist of sirnple nouns (N) (see
610 and 710),but they can also be expanded in nurnerous ways:
1. they can include a verb (V)
 138
Z. they can include a norninal particle(np)
3. they can include a dernonstrative pronoun (dp).

The Personal pronoun indi has already been discussed under
ir:.flection (see 621). Another personal pronoun is ikowa, which
is not inflected, but which denotes actiondone byoneself. (For
exarnples of its usage see 933. ) A case can be rnade, I think, for

-di to ernPhasize the subject or the object of the verb; -kowa to
 underline that the action was done by oneself.

The aflfixed or incorporated pronouns are used with transitive verbs to
 form what are called by the Spanish writers on Indian grammar transitions^
 that is, to express tie passage of the action from the agent or subject to
 the object. This usage is governed by very simple rules. In the Dakota and
 Hidatsa the rule prevails, that when two affixed pronouns come together,
 the one being in the nominative case and the other in the objective, the
objective always precedes the nominative, as in mayakor^'ca (Dak.) me-
