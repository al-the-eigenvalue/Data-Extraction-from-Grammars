Basque," God is good.
 b. Jainkoa da ona. (Lk 18:19; Lau Eb.)
 It is God who is good.
Sentence (39a), with the adjective ona ‘good’ as focus, answers the question Jainkoa nola-
koa da? ‘How is God?’ by ascribing to God the quality of goodness. Sentence (39b), where
Jainkoa ‘God’ is focus, answers a very di¤erent question: Nor da ona? ‘Who is good?’, and
so ﬁts the communicative intent of the text in Lk 18:19.

Basque," At times it is quite clearly the action expressed by the verb that is the focus of interest
within the sentence. To choose an example of the simplest kind, for the snow to be the
focus of the utterance ‘‘The snow has melted,’’ this statement would have to be conceived
of as an answer to the question ‘‘What has melted?’’ There are no doubt some circum-
stances in which this assumption might be correct, but in general a far more likely question
to be relevant here is ‘‘What has happened to the snow?’’, which makes the snow topic
rather than focus.

Question (4a) can be answered with bai or ez, ‘yes’ or ‘no’, while question (4b) cannot. It is
possible to insert the interrogative particle al or the dubitative particle ote in (4a), but not
in (4b). There are also clear intonation di¤erences between (4a) and (4b). When pro-
nounced with the same intonation as (4b), (4c), using unmarked edo, has the same meaning
as (4b). (Note that this use of edo is frowned upon by some grammarians, e.g., José
Basterrechea.)
 In summary,
edo: one or another, it doesn’t always matter which one
ala: either one or the other, the question is which one
In syntactic terms, the use of ala is limited to interrogative clauses in the broadest sense.
According to grammarian Patxi Goenaga, this means all clauses containing a wh-
complementizer, including direct questions, all complement clauses with the complemen-
tizer -N (see section 18.1.2), and nonﬁnite clauses using the radical form of the verb. Here
are some examples of each kind:

Amahuaca," Sentence (73) is very complex. We have dialogues, questions, and imperatives. Lines (73a, b) repeat
the event-process verbs meet/see/observe and wear/bring. In (a) I assigned the SRs: AG/anteater and
THEME/robe with MODs. The IRM SO refers back to the (implicit) SUBJ/AG/anteater and points
forward to the explicit DO/anteater in (b). It tells us that it is the anteater who is wearing the colourful
robe. Clause (a) is an embedded construction. The clause in (b) contains two arguments: AG/jaguar and
the already mentioned EXP/anteater. The jaguar is not only seeing but observing the anteater wearing
his colorful robe. This in connection with the historical past of the final independent verb makes him a
prototypical AG who is acting with volition. As he observes the anteater, he questions him (c) where he
got the robe. In (c) we find the ITR verb phrase ask with one SR: AG/jaguar who is posing a question. In
(d) we have the TR event verb phrase get/receive/obtain with three arguments: the SRs SOURCE/where,
AG/you/anteater, and THEME/robe with a MOD, a ‘nice’ item which has been received presumably as a
gift. The first word in (e) is a VOC, referring back to the AG/you/anteater. The verb answer in (e)
remains implicit. Answer in (e) is ITR and takes one argument: AG/anteater. He answers the jaguar’s
question by telling him, where he got his robe. The dominating verb phrase in (f, g) is get. It is a TR
event verb with the AG/I and an imbedded clause that has the following SRs: TIME/recently, REF/me
with the BENEF on the corresponding verb make, and AG/mother. His mother made the robe for the
anteater and he got it from her. The first clause in (h) has an implicit verb, answer with one argument:
AG/jaguar. The jaguar answers the anteater and expresses his desire to obtain the robe by suggesting
quite bluntly: “Give it to me in exchange for mine (his old dark one).” Give in (h) is a TR event verb that
actually has two arguments: GOAL/to me and the implicit DO/THEME/robe. In (i) the verb phrase give
again serves as the main event verb. While it expresses the purpose, the other verb phrase, copiquin ‘pay’
is optional and functions as a type of reassurance. The jaguar reassures the anteater that he is willing to
pay for his robe. The only explicit SR is mine/THEME which stands for the DO my robe. The final clause,
(j), serves to end the conversation: say is the main verb with two arguments: AG/jaguar and
EXP/anteater.

15.3.3 A-NOT-A QUESTIONS
A-not-A questions can be obtained through elicitation, but receive a reading from
native speakers as being less commonly used and a less-preferred strategy for forming
questions. A-not-A questions, nevertheless, can be overheard in everyday conversations.
The following structure, shown in (774), was given as a possible structure for an
interrogative, where the blank slot can be filled with a common noun, such as a foodstuff
or household item. Speakers suggest that the structure “_____ =ɑ31 dʑɔ33?” where =ɑ31
is the question marker and dʑɔ33 is an existential verb, is preferred over this A-not-A
question structure. However, ɑ31 =QM can also be used in conjunction with the A-not-A
question structure, as will be discussed in §15.3.4. A-not-A questions are a common
feature of Sinitic languages and languages in contact with Sinitic languages, and it is
possible that this structure is found in Na due to language contact rather than an inherent
feature.

15.3INTERROGATIVES
Na has a variety of methods for creating interrogatives. These are ɑ31 QM + V
(§15.3.1), V + ɑ31 QM (§15.3.2), A-not-A questions (§15.3.3), ɑ31 QM + A-not-A questions
(§15.3.4), questions using question words (§15.3.5), and questions marked with rising
intonation (§15.3.6).
15.3.1ɑ31 QM+ V questions
One common way to construct an interrogative in Na is to insert ɑ31 QM preceding
the verb. This construction is common with stative verbs (766) and (767), as well as with
modals (769) and verbs of motion (770).

reference available for speakers, it is interesting to see which is more eequently used, or

 In this section, I will concentrate on directional suffixes on verbs. It is important to
underscore thak since Pilaga lacks adpositions, directionals are employed as the resource

10.3 hterrosatives and Focused Constituents
 Interrogative sentencesare distinguished by the following features:
(a) They have an overt expression in sentence initial position that I refer to as the ""Question
 word"" (QUEST). These are separate syntactic words that appear in information questions
and yes-no questions.
(b) The question word normally attaches to classifiers, though some ofthem may
occur with no classifier. Question words are n-a 'which' B 'where' %a 'what' or
'whoY.",1,Question particle,"Based on the given paragraph, it is not clear which strategy of forming polar questions the language described in the grammar has. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information."".",Not enough information,1,0,

 10.4 C o m o d v e s and Equationid Sentences
Comparison and degree of quality are expressed by juxtaposed constructions in the
foilowing way: the Grst term of comparison comes first, with the adjective right
following it; after these two o c m the second term of comparison The comparative
term is aut'am which means 'to be Wt&esame as'; the comparative of inequality is
sa-ena'am which carries the negative prefix yl- and means 'not to be likehot the same
as'. Comparison is, therefore, done by conerasting phases within the same sentence.
 (a) Cacho logeda-ik sa-a-ena'amMarcelo
prop.name tall-masc NEG-setA.3-be.like prop name
'Cacho is taller than Marcelo.' (Lit., 'Cacho is tall; MarceIo is not like him.')
 (b) Emesto logeda-ik wna'am Leo
prop.name tall-masc setA3-be.like prop-name
 'Ernest0 is as tall as Leo.' (Lit. 'Ernesto is ta&Leo is like him.')
 (c) Ernestoyap'ota sa-a-aa'amNeike
prop.name thin NEG--3-be-like prop.oame
 'Emesto is thinner than Neike.' (Lit. 'Ernesto is thin; Neike is not like him. ')
(d) Tito poyolek sa-a-ma'am da' Ernesto
prop .name short NEG-setA3-be-like CL prop-name
 'Tito is shorter than Ernesto.' (Tio is short; Emesto is not like him')
Interestingly. when the two entities under comparison are expressed by
proa0un.s rather than by nouos, the negative B-aaaches to the second pronoun,
not to the verb form ena'am The negative prefix occurs between the adjective or
the property being compared and the second term of comparison,which the
negative prefix attaches to. The comparative ='am comes at the end of the
clause.
 (a) hayem tr\dafk saamsaa'am
 PRO.l sg bigNEG-PR0.2sg setA l -be like
 'I am bigger (in size) than you.' (Lit.,'I am big; You are not like me.')

 CL-dern big-PL NEG-PR0.2pi d 3 - b e like
'They are bigger than you @l.).' (Lit., 'They are big; you ail are not like them')
Comparing degrees of a quality involves an adjective that indicates 'degree of
quality'. modifying a noun which, in turn addresses the f-ebeing compared (16a-b).
(a) Julia sal& l a w Dominga
 Julia small waist Dominga
 'Julia (has) a smaller waist than Dominga'
(b) Julia tadaik lafai?ik Dominga
Juliabig waist Dominga
 'Julia (has) a bigger waist than Dominga'
Notice that in (17) there is no adjective; just the noun denoting the feature being
compared, i.e., iaEaaik and the verb form ena'am which occurs before the noun
(a) Jdia a-ena'amlaikdc Dominga
 Julia setA.3-be like waist Dominga
'Julia has the same waist as Dominga.' (Lit., 'Julia's waist is as Dominga's.')
Notes
Used in the expression wetab t'an'o nalaepa ""poor guy!""
Apparently, the same situation is found in Toba (C. Messineo, p.c) which uses weto'ot
to indicate either location or possession (e-g,R o d d o weto'ot na a('Lit., Romualdo
is under the shove'= 'Romualdo has a shove'). I thank Cristina Messinem for this
example.

14 Questions
Questions are of two types:
• In a – question, the expected answer to the
 question is “yes” or “no”. For example, in English Will
 you help me?, the likely answers are either “yes” or “no”
 (or some expansion or equivalent).
",0,Question particle,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not clear which strategy of forming polar questions the language described in the grammar have. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information"".",Not enough information,0,0,polar questions
Yurok,"• In a  question, the range of likely answers is
 much broader. For example, in English Who will help
 me?, there is a range of possible answers (“Alice”, “Bill”,
 “Charlie”, “Donna”, etc.).
In many languages, yes–no questions and content questions
are formed in diﬀerent ways. In English, for example, con-
tent questions use a word such as where?, what?, why?, etc.,
while yes–no questions are formed by changing word order:
Can you hear me? Yurok too has two diﬀerent methods for
forming the two types of questions.
14.1Yes–no questions Figure 7: Alice Spott in 1907
Yes–no questions are formed using the question particle hes,
positioned either at the end of the sentence (this is less common) or (more often) after the ﬁrst word or
phrase of the sentence. The examples below are divided into two groups: neutral questions, where the
answer might be “yes” or “no” (there is no expected answer) and questions expecting a negative answer,
where the expected answer is “no”.
14.1.1 Neutral yes–no questions
The most common position for hes is immediately after the ﬁrst word of the sentence, as in (86).
(86)Questions with hes after the ﬁrst word

14.2 Content questions
Unlike yes–no questions, content questions seek a more open-ended answer to questions like “who?”,
“when?”, “where?”, etc. They can be classiﬁed according to the type of information they seek, and also
according to their form. In Yurok, content questions are formed using one of the question words tee’now,
tee’neesho, and kues. Among these, kues is the most ﬂexible.
14.2.1Who? What?
Questions that ask “who?”, as in (90), use the question word tee’now.

Recall that in some questions, the piece of information under interrogation is not
the entire clause, but a portion of it. For example, in (116a), cited earlier as (109b),

be the main verb alone (116b).

Answers to polar questions are in principle either yes or no. Example (113a),
cited earlier as (109a), gives a question with a complement-taking verb „know‟ and a
subordinate verb „speak.‟ A positive answer to this question could minimally consist of
the main verb alone (114a), but it can also include the main and the subordinate clause

Cocama,"Long forms
Long forms are used for expressing various types of focus. Following the
typology introduced in §11.1.2, we have found that long forms are employed, for
example, in information questions and answers to those questions. This would be a case
of completive focus, in which the focused information is filling a gap in the hearer‟s
 722
knowledge. Examples (41b, 42b) are answers to the information questions presented in
(41a, 42a). Strictly speaking, in (41b, 42b), either short or long forms could be used;
however, a long form is preferred.
(41)a. awa=tipa ikian maraweyaukia-ri
 who-QDEM fan do-PROG
 „Who is doing this fan‟
b. etseyaukia-ri
 1SG.L.Fdo-PROG
 „I‟m doing (it)‟
(42)a. awa-tipa ene
 person-Q 2SG.L
„Who is there?‟ (Lit. Who are you?)
b. etse
 1SG.L.F
 „(It‟s) me‟
Another example of completive focus using a long form pronoun is presented in
(43). The speaker is describing the day that the teacher arrived in the community. A
boat was approaching the village but it was not yet close enough to identify who was
coming. The interaction of some community members in this particular context is
presented in (43). First they started guessing (43a-b). After one of them identified who
the person was, he made a strong assertion using (43c), where he uses the third person
singular long form uri to refer to the person in question.
(43)a. wepe awa uri-ari,
 onepersoncome-PROG
 „Somebody is coming‟
b. ikua-ta-wara-taka uri-ari,
know-CAU-DER-MOD come-PROG
 „Maybe the teacher is coming‟
723
c. uri uri-ari
 3SG.L.M come-PROG
„[Yes], he [is the one that] is coming‟
However, in some questions, the missing information is not always the only
piece in focus. The sequence of examples in (44) comes from a story about a man who
is looking for his girlfriend in the darkness of the night. At some point, he starts calling
her:
(44)a. maka=tip(a)=ene, waina=kɨra
 Where=Q=2SG.L, woman=DIM
„Where are you, little woman?‟
b. ajan=ka etse
 DEM=LOC 1SG.L.F
„Here I am‟
Note that in (44a) the second person long form appears attached to the
interrogative word, and this is the only form allowed there. Interestingly, in (44a) the
missing information is the location. However, the answer has multiple foci, „where‟ and
„who.‟ In (44b), the location appears in sentential position and the located person is
expressed by the long form.
",0,Question particle,The given paragraph does not provide enough information about the language's strategy of forming polar questions.,Not enough information,0,0,content questions
Cocama,"In the following paragraphs I describe in some detail polar questions (§9.4.1)
and content questions (§9.4.2).
9.4.1. Polar questions
Polar question are typically employed to inquire about the truth or falsity of the
proposition they express often with focus on one specific part of the proposition (Givón
2001). Cross-linguistically, six strategies to encode polar questions have been found.
These are “(i) special intonation patterns, (ii) interrogative particles, (iii) the addition of
special tags, (iv) disjunctive-negative structures, (v) a change in the relative order of
537
constituents and (vi) particular verbal inflection” (König & Siemund, 2007:292). KK
employs three of these strategies to form polar questions: the interrogative particle
=tipa, constituent order alternation, and, more marginally, intonation.

 Echo questions take the same form as regular questions, though it is

",0,Interrogative verb morphology,"The language described in the grammar has the strategy of forming polar questions using ""Interrogative intonation only"".",Interrogative intonation only,1,0,polar questions
Qiang," Verbal morphology 207
To make a strong statement of certainty, or of information that was
not recently discovered, but known for some time, then a clause
nominalized by /-s/ and followed by the copula is used without /tån/ or
/lå-h˙n/ (this construction was also discussed in §4.3.6). This form
cannot be used for past/perfective actions.

 b. the: thå-Âi-s ≥u˙.

 ÆS/he is definitely there.ﬂ
4.3.7.5. Correlations with other grammatical categories
Use of evidential marking in a question is not obligatory, as long as no
assumptions about the source of the addresseeﬂs information are made,
but if it is used, in the case of the visual or hearsay marking it would
imply the assumption that the hearer saw (visual, as in (4.239a)), or
heard about (hearsay, as in (4.239b)), the action being questioned. It is
the action that is questioned, not the source of the information.

 3sg DIR-go-VISQ
 ÆDid he go?ﬂ
 b. the: ¿å-q˙-i ≥uå?
 3sg DIR-go-HS Q
 ÆDid he go?ﬂ
If the speaker of a question assumes the addressee of the question
also does not have visual evidence of information about the situation
being asked about (though knows more about the situation than the
speaker), the inferential particle can be used in the question, as in
(4.240):
208 The verb complex
(4.240) the: hå-q˙-k ≥uå?
 3sg DIR-go-INFQ
 ÆDid he go?ﬂ
The form used by the one responding to the question would then depend
on the source of that personﬂs information, visual, inference or hearsay.

Qiang,"Verbal morphology 179
(4.155) stuåhå˚å:-t˚-k˙.
food/rice INDTV-eat-go
ÆLet (him/her) go eat!ﬂ
If the verb taking the third person form also could take one of the
directional prefixes (see §4.3.3) in a particular context, it is possible to
either replace the prefix with /˚å:-/, or simply change the vowel of the
prefix to /å:/, as in the following examples:
(4.156) a.p˙ Æbuyﬂ > zå:-p˙ ± ˚å:-p˙ Æallow 3sg to buyﬂ
b.t˚h˙ Ædrinkﬂ > så:-t˚ ± ˚å:-t˚ Æallow 3sg to drinkﬂ

e.tse Ælookﬂ > a:-tse ± ˚a:-tse Æallow 3sg to lookﬂ
f.phe Ædig (horizontally)ﬂ > ¿a:-πe ± ˚a:-πe Æallow 3sg to digﬂ
The form with /˚å:/ is more emphatic than the form where the initial of
the prefix is retained. For plural referents the plural marker /-t˚i/ is
added after the verb.
4.3.5.3. Interrogatives
Yes-no questions are marked by rising intonation and by the addition of
the clause-final syllable /-nå/ for second person singular actors/topics,
or /-≥uå/ (often pronounced [wå]) for all actors/topics of all other
persons and numbers. The question particle that is part of these forms is
outside the verb complex, and so follows aspect and person/number
marking, but is discussed here with the other illocutionary force
markings. The form /-nå/ is comprised of the second person singular
person marking /-n/ plus the question particle /-å/, though the non-
second person singular question particle /-≥uå/ does not seem to derive
from the copula /≥u˙/ plus /-å/, as /≥uå/ often follows the copula. It also
does not seem to be a form of the third person non-actor marking (as is
the case with the debitive construction; see §4.3.6.3) plus /-å/, as the
aspect and person marking suffixes appear on the element preceding
/≥uå/.
",1,Interrogative verb morphology,,,0,1,

Qiang," Question particles are used even if interrogative pronouns are used in
the clause. Interrogative pronouns can appear in initial position, second
position, or immediately preverbal position, depending on the overall
context (e.g. the difference between (4.176) and (4.177) is whether the
table is topical (4.176) or not (4.177)), and can take the same case
markers as lexical nouns and other pronouns (see §3.1.2).

 The order of words in the question is generally reflected in the
answer, e.g. if the interrogative pronoun is in initial position, then the
answer also appears in initial position. The answer to a question
involving an interrogative pronoun can be a whole clause, or may
simply be the noun phrase representing the information completing the
open proposition (i.e. the question), with or without case marking.

7.1.3. Constituent orders of the clause
In §7.1.1 and §7.1.2, we show the structures of nominal phrase and verb complex. We
can see the order of elements in a clause in the Puxi variety of Qiang in terms of the
noun phrase structure and the verb complex structure. A clause may be a phrase, i.e.
Se-%i-n? ‘who are you?’. The canonical constituent order of the clause in the Puxi
variety of Qiang is as in Figure 8:
 Chapter 7: Simple Structures224
 (i) Noun phrase + Verb complex (Intransitive clause)
 (ii) Noun phrase1 + Noun phrase2 + Verb complex(Transitive clause)
 Figure 8. The canonical constituent order of the clause
An intransitive clause consists of a noun phrase plus a verb complex (SV), whereas a
transitive clause comprises two noun phrases plus a verb complex (APV). This is the
basic structure of a clause, other elements are also possible.
7.2. Interrogatives
There are three types of interrogative in the Puxi variety of Qiang, i.e. yes/no question,
alternative question and question word question. Yes/no question is discussed in
§7.2.1, alternative question is given in §7.2.2, and question word question is discussed
in §7.2.3.
7.2.1. Yes/No questions
Yes/No question refers to interrogative clauses for soliciting information or requesting
a thing or an action, whose expected answer is either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. The Puxi variety of
Qiang uses the sentential final question particle a, or me, with rising intonation, or
the particle b`, with falling intonation, to encode this type of question:

The question marker in the Puxi variety of Qiang may occur at the end of the first

alternative question, as in (443)-(445):

7.2.3. Question-word questions
Question-word questions mark the clause as a question and indicate what information
is being requested (Payne 2002: 300). Question-word questions of the Puxi variety of
Qiang have the question word in the same syntactic position in questions as the
Chapter 7: Simple Structures 230

to initial position, as in English (see §4.1.6.4) .

7.3. Negation
Negation in the Puxi variety of Qiang is achieved by adding the negative prefix mi- or
the prohibitive prefix tse- before the verb (see §6.4).

 Activities, in general, are dynamic and temporally unbounded, such as motion,
light emission, sound emission, performance, consumption, creation, repetitive action,
directed perception, and use (Van Valin & LaPolla 1997:115). In the Puxi variety of
Qiang, activities, like states, use the orientation prefixes and the change of state
marking to form achievements or accomplishments, and take the causative suffix to
express causative achievements and accomplishments:
 Ru` ‘to collapse’ Activity
 E$-Ru`-i‘to have collapsed’ Achievement
 E$-Rlu`-zE-i‘to cause to become collapsed’Causative Achievement
 l`‘to fly’Activity

4.2.5. Copulas
There are two copulas in the Puxi variety: mEi and No. The copula mEi is used in
identificational, equational, attributive, and pseudo-cleft constructions. It also appears
after nominalized verbs. In most cases, the copula may be omitted when the copula
 Chapter 4: Word Classes 101
complement (CC) or a clause in the pseudo-cleft construction takes the indefinite
marker -%i, as in (126):

The copulas can take person marking in the identificational construction, but do not

first and second person marking.

Darma has three ways to mark tag questions. These can be grouped into two
categories: ‘biased’ tags and ‘confirmation’ tags (Kroeger 2005: 205). The former is “a
true request for information, in the sense that the speaker requires an answer from the
hearer; but it signals an expectation or preference on the part of the speaker for one
particular answer to be given.” The latter is “much the same as a declarative statement,
494
with the tag question serving only as a request for feedback from the hearer”. These
categories will be discussed in turn below.

 Chapter 17: Clause and Sentence Structure
17.0INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, I will discuss the some of the clause types that are prominent in
the discourse that I have analyzed for this dissertation. This will include: a discussion of
non-declarative speech acts (cf §17.1); nominalization and relativization (cf §17.2); and
evidentiality (cf § 17.3). This chapter is by no means an exhaustive analysis of the
structure of clauses and utterances in Darma, but it is a launching point for further work.
17.1NON-DECLARATIVE SPEECH ACTS
There are several types of non-declarative speech act found in Darma: yes/no
questions, information questions, and tag questions. Each type of question formation will
be discussed in turn in the following sub-sections.
17.1.1 Yes/No Questions
Cross-linguistically, yes/no questions are formed in several ways. One can use
rising intonation, a particle or a clitic, or a verbal affix to mark a yes/no question
(Kroeger 2005). Darma uses two of these strategies, which can also be used in
combination. Questions that seek an answer of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ are formed in the following
ways: with rising intonation; with the question marker kha in clause-initial position; or
with both rising intonation and the question marker. The basic constituent order of a
question remains unchanged in yes/no questions whether or not the question particle kha
is present. Compare the declarative sentence in (1) below with the yes/no question in (2)
below. The latter example has the same constituent order as the former, but kha is in
clause-initial position and the intonation is rising.
",1,Question particle,"The language described in the grammar has two strategies for forming polar questions: with rising intonation and the question marker ""kha"" in clause-initial position, or with both rising intonation and the question marker.

17.1.2 Information Questions
 The class of interrogative words used to form information questions are shown in
Table 17.1.2 below (this table was originally presented in §9.5 above).
1 The fact that these constructions are usually interpreted as questions wasn’t always apparent.
Occasionally, during elicitation or translation sessions, when my primary consultant would come across
what appeared on the surface as a second person declarative he would explain that the construction was a
question not a statement. Frequently this was an afterthought. I checked utterances that had not been
recorded as questions, and determined that the basic declarative constituent order for second person is
generally interpreted as a question.

9.5.1.1.2. Interrogative particles
The most explicit means of forming polar questions is via one of several available
illocutionary force particles, all of which occur in the same (predicative or appositive)
clause-final syntactic position, but which vary in terms of semantic value and pragmatic
implications. Among them, ree ‘PQ’ is the functionally “unmarked” polar question marker

 Dubitative larèe ‘DUB’ has the same distribution as Polar interrogative ree. It
indicates speaker surprise at seeing an indication that the marked information is or should
be the case, and forms an insistent polar question to verify whether it is or is not so (in
principle, probably expecting a negative answer) (791). In cases where the speaker and

the sense is closer to a rhetorical question, possibly with disapproving and/or mirative

 The second formative of Dubitative larèe clearly reflects Polar interrogative ree,
however the initial formative is unknown. Although Dubitative larèe occurs relatively
infrequently in my corpus, it is commonly believed among my consultants that Dubitative
larèe is namesake of the Lare (larèe) dialect of Galo which forms the focus of this

description (in Pugo Galo, the corresponding form is lee). I am unable to comment on the
likelihood of this being true or not.
13.3.3.3. Assumptive interrogative rem
Assumptive interrogative rem marks information whose truth/falsity is unknown
to the speaker, but which the speaker believes is known to the addressee. Inasmuch as it
entails a speaker assumption concerning the addressee’s knowledge, it forms a fairly
impatient or insistent-sounding type of question. Although it appears that Assumptive
interrogative rem must derive from Polar interrogative ree plus a following formative m –
which, in turn may reflect either Temporal subordinator әәm, Resolutive m or some (other)
reflex of a PT object-marker *m – Assumptive interrogative rem can mark both polar and
content cleft interrogative clauses (793)-(794).

Galo," Unfortunately, there is no easy answer here. Some “word” criteria are relatively
robust, and apply to disyllabic sequences only; these include fricative and underspecified
consonant realization, (§3.2.4, §3.4.2) and the prohibition against internal pauses or
glottal stop (§4.1.3.4). However, such criteria are clearly not applicable in every case, as
when fricatives or underspecified consonants are not present in the sequence in question.
Other “word” criteria also apply sporadically to sequences larger than two syllables. For
example, assimilation sandhi (§4.1.3.7) may apply sporadically across word boundaries
(although they are never obligatory in this context, unlike within a word). Word-final
vowel length neutralization (§4.1.4.4) may or may not occur at the boundary of the
second and third syllable of a trisyllabic word, and the question of whether a particular
trisyllabic sequence represents one metrical foot (with one stress position only) or two,
and whether the two stressed slots are equal or unequal are both very difficult questions
on which I have found considerable disagreements among native speakers (see also
§4.2.3).

As estratégias utilizadas nas construções topicalizadas são deslocamento à esquerda
(lefl dislocation) e tópico contrastivo (Y-movement).
4.4.1.4.1 Tópico (deslocamento à esquerda)
 As características sintáticas e tipológicas do deslocamento à esquerda são:
um contorno entonacional separado do NP deslocado;
neutralização da marcação de caso do NP tópico;
retomada pronominal do NP tópico na sentença (se OD).

em posição de 'sujeito'.
O Timbira falado pelos

Capítulo 3
 Classes de palavras
O tempo passado vívido, como o próprio nome já diz, descreve uma situação que se
realizou antes do momento da fala e que ainda é recente na perspectiva do falante. A
oposição distante I vívido 8 representa, assim, um contraste aspectual mais fino na
codificação do passado.
(432)h-spsn
 3-comer (passado vívido)
 'ele comeu (há pouco tempo)'
(433)pe0 aps
 PD 3-comer
 'ele comeu (quando era pequeno)'
(434)r;,pte i-tfar
 cachorroERG l-morder (passado vívido)
 'o cachorro me mordeu (há pouco tempo)'
(435)per;,p i-tfa
 PD cachorro l-morder
 'o cachorro me mordeu (quando eu era pequena)'
Não existe uma fronteira evidente para definir o que é um evento mais recente ou
um menos recente. A explicação dos falantes é de que o passado distante é usado para
expressar situações que ocorreram há mais tempo, e não necessariamente há muito tempo,
embora ele possa também ser usado nessas situações. Nesse sentido, o termo 'distante' não
define bem esse contraste aspectual de proximidade que existe nas construções que
denotam passado perfectivo. Por isso, a oposição 'mais ou menos próximo' parece mais
bem descrita pelos termos 'passado vívido' vs 'passado afastado', lembrando que o que vai
definir o uso de um passado ou outro é a perspectiva do falante. No entanto, usarei a
denominação 'passado simples' para referir-me as construções que expressam passado
vívido e 'passado distante' para o passado afastado.

Present -r, -ra 〜 -da
Future-jigaa
PastV-saa 〜 C-caa
Generally, participle forms have three syntactically different functions:(1)an attribute of
a noun (see 4.14 below);(2) a verbal-noun, which may take a case-ending (see 4.27);and (3) a
predicate, which is frequently used in both future and past tense. Each ending may take a
personal marker which is partially the same with nominal possessive marker,but with no 3rd
person marking:1S -w (〜-uu combined with preceding aa),1P.EXCL -mun,1P.INCL -ti,2S -si,
2P -sun.

 SG PL
 1st bii ［min-, ACC minewe］ buu［mun-, ACC munewe］(EXCL)
miti (INCL)
 2nd sii ［sin-, ACC sinewe］ suu［sun-, ACC sunewe］
 The personal pronouns, except for the 1P inclusive form,are inflected on the basis of the
alternative stems given in square brackets. The case-endings are basically the same as nouns,
but actual occurrence of several cases is much restricted. The accusative forms are somewhat
irregular as shown above. For the third person, demonstrative pronouns eri/tari ʻ this/thatʼ
and their plural forms ersel/tarsal〜taccil ʻthese/thoseʼ,elur /talur (＜eri/tari ulur)ʻthese/those
peopleʼetc.are usually employed. Only rarely is used the original third person pronoun nugan
(PL nugan-sal), which may express politeness to the referent.

The paragraph mainly discusses the noun and pronoun system of the language and does not provide any information about question formation.",Not enough information,0,0,

, which is followed by the negated verb in the
participle form -ra.
(20)unege eme-re. (HC 90)
［not.yet come-PRES］
 ʻ
 (He)has not come yet.ʼ
4.24 Interrogative sentences
The interrogative clitic -gii is added to the end of yes-no questions, with which a rising
intonation is usually accompanied. In answer, the interjection word en/oo/oon etc. may be
headed for affirmative answer, and onto/aasin for negative:
(21)eri uxur aya-gii?
［this ox good-Q］
 ʻ
 Is this ox good?ʼ
(22)eri bitig sin-ii-gii?
［this book you-GEN-Q］
 ʻ
 Is this book yours?ʼ
(23a)oon, min-ii.
［yes me-GEN］
 ʻ
 Yes, (it is)mine.ʼ
(23b)onto, eri sin-ii.
 ［no this you-GEN］
ʻNo, (it is not mine but)yours.ʼ
For confirmation of a statement, a sentence-final particle baa (＜Chi. ba) is occasionally
employed:
Toshiro Tsumagari A Sketch of Solon Grammar15
(24)tari uli-see baa? (HC 107)
 ［he go-PAST PT］
ʻHe went, didnʼ t he?ʼ
For wh-questions,no interrogative marking is needed except for some emphatic particles:
(25)eri si oxon yeeme? (CTK 72)
 ［this TOP what PT］
ʻWhat is this?ʼ
(26)sin-ii gebbi-si aawu? (CTK 13)
 ［you-GEN name-2S who］
ʻWhat is your name?ʼ

ʻWhere do you live?ʼ
(28)beejin jakka ooxi goro bi-si-n? (CTK 10)
 ［Beijing up.to how far be-PRES-3］
ʻHow far is it to Beijing?ʼ
4.25 Comparative sentences
Adjectives and adverbs have no grammatical degree of comparison. The compared object
takes the ablative case:
(29)eri uxur morin-duxi sampal. (HC 40)
 ［this ox horse-ABL agile］
ʻThis ox is agile than a horse.ʼ
(30)eri inig tiinug negeen tannagan exuddi onto. (CTK 45)
 ［this day yesterday alike such hot not］
ʻToday is not so hot as yesterday.ʼ
Superlative meaning is expressed by adding the adverb miin/miinti ʻ mostʼ
:
(31)iggu-nin miin aya? (CTK 37)
 ［which-3 most good］
ʻWhich is the best?ʼ
The following idiomatic expression makes use of a “nominalized”adjective:
(32)talar aya-nii aya-waa-ni ga-mi gurun-du-wi buu-see. (C 211)
 ［they good-GEN good-ACC-3 take-COOR country-DAT-REF give-PAST］
ʻThey chose the best of the bests and offered it to their country.ʼ
4.26 Passive/Causative sentences
Passive and causative sentences are expressed morphologically by adding a suffix to a verb-
16北方人文研究 第２号 2009年３月
stem respectively(for several verbal derivational suffixes,see 3.51 above). As a rule,the agent
in passive sentence takes the dative case,while in causative the agent (causee)is marked bythe
accusative or instrumental case. The sentence (39) is an example of a passive-causative
combination:
 (33)bii e-du munda-wu-suu. (HC 62)
［I this-DAT hit-PASS-PAST.1S］
 ʻI was hit by him.ʼ
 (34)xonin tuulge-du jawa-wu-saa. (HC 26)

 ʻThe box you had the craftsman make is very beautiful.ʼ
 (39)tari min-ewe munda-wu-xaan-caa. (C 81)
［he me-ACC hit-PASS-CAUS-PAST］
 ʻHe let me be hit.ʼ(＝He made someone hit me.)
4.27 Complex sentences
 Sentences with various converbs;note that the converbs with personal marking (42, 43)
have a different subject from that of main verbs:
 (40)bii moolaa-taani beyusi-geti. (HC 82)
［I make.firewood-PERF go.hunting-IMP.1S］
 ʻHaving finished making firewood, I will go hunting.ʼ
 (41)tari arxi imi-gii imi-gii sotto-soo. (HC 83)
［he liquor drink-DUR drink-DUR get.drunk-PAST］
 ʻHe drank and drank and got drunk.ʼ

 ʻIf you go, I will go.ʼ
 (43)bii uxxe-du ii-jixee-weye, batu min-ewe tan-saa. (HC 80)
［I door-DAT enter-SUC-1S Batu me-ACC notice-PAST］
 Toshiro Tsumagari A Sketch of Solon Grammar17
 ʻ
 As soon as I entered the door, Batu noticed me.ʼ
 Participle forms can make a noun clause and function as a sentence element with some
case ending. The dative forms are used adverbially to express time, reason etc.:
 (44)sin-ii jinji-saa-wa-si saa-suu. (C 194)
 ［you-GEN talk-PAST-ACC-2S know-PAST.1S］
 ʻ

 (45)morin ugu-r-du-wi aya-ji xise-xe. (C 195)
 ［horse ride-PRES-DAT-REF good-INS be.careful-IM P.2S］
 ʻ

 (46)sin-ii eme-see-du-si buu addaji-mun. (CTK 21)
 ［you-GEN come-PAST-DAT-2S we be.glad-PRES.1P.EXCL］
 ʻ
 We are glad that you came.ʼ
 Concessive meaning is expressed by a clitic -xat ʻ yetʼor a particle jaarin ʻthoughʼ:
 (47)iittu jinji-saa-xat asir aasin. (CTK 63)
 ［how talk-PAST-yet merit no］
 ʻ
 Whatever (one)says, it is no use.ʼ
 (48)ooxi jogo-soo jaarin, bu-see beye daxii e-jigee iinigge-r xun. (CTK 69)
 ［how grieve-PAST though die-PAST man again not-FUT revive-PRES PT］
 ʻ
 No matter how (you)grieve, a dead person will never revive again.ʼ
 Quotational sentences make use of gu ken ʻsayingʼor some other forms of the verb gun-
ʻto sayʼ :
 (49)kinoo isi-mi gu ken joonji-mi. (CTK 53)
 ［movie see-PRES.1S saying think-PRES.1S］
 ʻ

 (50)tari sin-ewe da a-ya e-ji imi-ra gunji-ren. (HC 144)
 ［he you-ACC tobacco-INAC not-IMP.2S drink-PRES say-PRES］
 ʻ

5.1 Loanwords
There are many Chinese loanwords: s ko ʻ windowʼ , xooco ʻ trainʼ
,dnsi ʻtelevisionʼ
 , g bii
ʻpenʼ, liibʻweekʼetc. Not only nominals, but also other parts of speech are borrowed:an
adverb maa an ʻpromptlyʼ,an interjection wei ʻhi,helloʼ,or even grammatical particles like si

 ［yesterday night run.away-PAST horse TOP this PT］
ʻThe horse which ran away last night is this.ʼ
4.22 Existential/Possessive sentences
Possession is represented either as an existential sentence with bi- ʻ to be, existʼor by a
possessive adjective suffix -si ʻ
having, withʼ . The form in -si can also modify another noun:

(7)sire-nii oroon-du-ni bitig bi-si-n.
 ［desk-GEN surface-DAT-3 book be-PRES-3］

(10)morin-si beye
［horse-POS man］

4.23 Negative sentences
Negation is primarily expressed by the negative verb e-ʻ do notʼwith the participle form -ra of
negated verb:
(11)bii emun naan e-si-m saa-ra. (CTK 12)
［I one yet not-PRES-1S know-PRES］
 ʻ

(12)tari beye e-see nini-re.
［that man not-PAST go-PRES］
 ʻ
 He didnʼt go.ʼ
For the negation of nominal/adjectival sentences,an adjective onto ʻdifferent,notʼor aasin
ʻnoʼis employed:
(13)eri min-ii morin onto.
［this me-GEN horse not］
 ʻ
 This is not my horse.ʼ
(14)sin-ii jinji-saa-si negeen amakkun onto. (C 190)
［you-GEN talk-PAST-2S alike easy not］
 ʻ

(15)gaga-nii juu-nin e-duxi goro aasin. (C 223)
［elder.brother-GEN house-3 this-ABL far no］
 ʻ
 M y brotherʼs house is not far from here.ʼ
The latter aasin is also used to express nonexistence, with which the preceding noun
(nonexistent) occasionally takes the indefinite accusative case or also in -la, which may
tentatively be called abessive, found in the same construction of some other Tungusic:
(16)beye aasin juug-du ii-mi e-si-n oo-do. (C 222)
［man no house-DAT enter-COOR not-PRES-3 become-PRES］

The same morphosyntactic pattern is found with the semantically more generic verb lóeng
when it is used with the sense ‘answer’ (though not when it simply means ‘say’ or ‘tell, order’,

separate albeit phonologically undifferentiable verbs). The question described in (68) could be
replied to with lóeng ‘answer’ as seen in (68)', which has only one possible reading, but (69)

Cubeo,"An important difference between stative and progressive aspect is the fact that
the progressive describes a situation as developing phase-by-phase, whereas the stative
aspect describes a situation as a static, undifferentiated whole or as a single point.
Hence, the classic Vendlerian (cf. Vendler 1957) diagnose to distinguish between states
and events can be applied to differentiate Kubeo stative aspect and the progressive.27 To
a question as in (8.86), only the progressive form in (8.87a) can be a proper answer, but
not a verb in the stative aspect, as in (8.87b).
26
 As it is demonstrated in (8.87) below, sentences (8.85a,b) cannot be faithfully translated by the English
progressive, nor the past as attempted in (8.85a). (8.85b) is more similar to the in simple present sentences
as here comes the rain (though there is no 'here' operator in the Kubeo sentence [but perhaps the evidential
can be analyzed as equivalent to the 'here' operator]). (8.81c) can be well translated by the idea of habitual
in English simple present, though in Kubeo it is distinct from the habitual.
27
 Vendler (1957) proposes the use of questions such as ""What is he doing?"" whose answer always has to be
in the progressive, whereas a state cannot respond to that question, such ""*He loves Mary"".

 QWs in general are the first element in the left edge of the sentence, as
illustrated below:
(9.86) a. 'a#pɨe bahi aða-hi?

'in which exact basket should I put (it)'
 b. 'ãrĩda-jɨ=dɨ̃ ?
where come-NMZ.MSC=2.INTRR
'where are you coming from?'
 c. jãbẽ eda-di ?

Nevertheless, in a few cases, another constituent can precede a QW:
(9.87) a. bãhãaipe#te-dĩ ea-be-di ?

'why we have not arrived so far?'
 b. 'hi#tãrãijo hipokoro-de jãbẽ koba-di?

word constituent, but in exceptional cases, another constituent can be focalized and can
precede the question word.

Cubeo," Finally, inherently negative quantifiers do not exist in Kubeo. In fact negation is
 a property of verbs, rather than predicates or even NPs. In addition, because Kubeo has
 a specific indefinite pronoun, and negative quantifiers are usually semantically
 indefinite cross-linguistically, it is not surprising that in Kubeo most expressions of
 negation are achieved by a combination of a negated verb plus the indefinite pronoun.
 For example, 'nothing' is expressed by the indefinite pronoun 'je (see section 8.6
 above), however 'nobody' is expressed by the question word jãbẽ 'who' in combination
 with the word bahu 'intensifier' (which is optionally, but frequently, attached to
 350
The Phonology and Morphology of Kubeo
temporal adverbs and quantifiers to express the idea of an exact amount)8 and a negated
verb marked for declarative mood. This construction is illustrated below:

 who INTENS person-AN.P come-NEG-ASM.3AN.P
 'nobody will come here'.
 b.jãbẽ bahu'hi#õarĩdẽbohe-be#ða-wɨ
 who INTENS my#pigtheirpay-NEG#make-N.3AN
 'no body wanted to buy my pig'
9.8 Question Words
 Question words (QW) in Kubeo are listed in table 11 below:

The QWs followed by ""#"" are dependent stems, requiring an affix, clitic or noun
complement. QW for instruments, e.g. 'with what', are marked by the indefinite pronoun
and the instrumental affix –ke or by the converb kõhĩo-dĩ (be.together-CONV), as in je-
ke 'with what?' and je kõhĩo-dĩ 'with what?'.

Part I Introduction
SOUNDS AND THE ALPHABET
Vowels
There are six vowel sounds. They are represented by the following letters:
 a, e, i, o, u, <
The first four are oral vowels and correspond to the following English sounds:
aas in ah or father
eas in they
ias in ski
oas in no
The last two are nasal vowels spoken as if an n sound always followed:
uas in tune
<as in ton
Consonants
Four consonants are known as resonants and are very close to the sounds of the English
letters:
las in low
nas in no
was in will
yas in yes
 Examples: la lo ye y< wa wi nu n<
h
There is also an h sound, which is pronounced as a breath of air as in hello. This sound
is far more common in Oneida than it is in English and it occurs in Oneida in places
such as before consonants where it does not occur in English. The sound itself is not
difficult for English speakers to produce, but it will take some practice to produce it
before consonants.

Part IIIThe Basic Noun
NOUNS
Oneida has several types of nouns.
One type is the whole word noun. It is not made up of stems, prefixes, and suffixes but
exists simply as a whole word itself. There are, however, very few nouns in this class.
Examples are é=lhal dog and takós cat and k%skos pig.
A second type of noun is built from a noun stem. Just as with the verbs, noun stems can
be identified by their beginning sound. A-stems typically have no prefix but may have a
suffix. Consonant stems typically have either a ka- or an o- prefix plus some suffix.
These prefixes and suffixes do not add to the meaning of the noun but they are required
in order to turn the stem into a word. Some examples:
 stemwordEnglish
-n<st- o=n§ste corn
-÷sleht- ká=slehtcar, vehicle
-n<y-on<=y@stone
-(u)hw<tsy-ohw§tsyaearth
-w<n-ow<=náword, sound, voice
-ahta- áhtashoe
-at<na÷tsl-at<ná=tsehlilunch, groceries
The particular choice of prefix and suffix is not predictable just by knowing the stem and
meaning. It is something that has to be learned for each word.
The third type of noun is actually a word constructed as a verb and used as a noun. The
verb often is a description of the noun. Examples:
shukwaya÷tísuhe has made us = the creator
kaw<naye=nás it word-catches = tape recorder
iy§haI am parent to him = my son
tyoh<=tú one who leads = the boss
yakolihuny<=níhe she makes the tradition for them = teacher
sk<hnáks<it has bad skin = fox
lotl$hutethe idea comes off of him = (he is) an official
kan&hsotethe house is standing = house
on<yote>a=k@=people of the standing stone = Oneidas
 28
NOUNS IN SIMPLE SENTENCES
Oneida has a word for this - ka÷i=k§ - and a word for that - thi=k§ - but there is no
word for to be (am, is, are, was, were). Simple identification questions are:
 náhte÷ ka÷i=k§what is this?
 náhte÷ thi=k§ what is that?
náhte÷ is the word for what. The particle né= can also be used in identification questions.
It has about the same meaning:
 náhte÷ né= ka÷i=k§what is this?
 náhte÷ né= thi=k§ what is that?
Answers to identification questions can take the following forms:
 ká=sleht ka÷i=k§this is a car
 ká=sleht né= ka÷i=k§this is a car
 né= né= ka÷i=k§ ká=slehtwhat this is is a car
Yes-no questions with a noun take the following forms:
 ká=sleht k< is it a car?
 ká=sleht k< thi=k§is that a car?
 né= k< thi=k§ ká=slehtis that a car?
THE VERB WANT

Who Questions
The Oneida expression for who is úhka÷ náhte÷. By itself this is pronounced &hka>
n@hohte. It is also possible to use just &hka> without n@hte> or n@hohte. Unless you know
specifically that the answer will be a male, who-questions always use a feminine pronoun
prefix on the verb. The general rule is that if you don't know whether you're talking
about a male or female, then you assume female as an indefinite form.
úhka÷ náhte÷ yakonúhte who knows?
úhka÷ náhte÷ yakotunháhehlewho is happy?
úhka÷ náhte÷ yenú=wehsewho likes it?
úhka÷ náhte÷ shenolúhkwa who(m) do you love?
úhka÷ náhte÷ shey§ha who is your daughter?
Negative statements
Negative statements are made by adding the particle yah before the verb and by attaching
a special negative prefix to the verb. This is usually te÷- (or just te- before an h or s)
and it is one of the dozen or so prepronominal prefixes. If the verb already has a
prepronominal prefix, then the negative prefix often combines or fuses with that prefix in
ways that will be explained later.
yah te÷yakonúhte she doesn't know
yah teshukwanolúhkwa he doesn't love us
yah te÷wakanúhte I don't know
yah te÷knú=wehse I don't like it
The h - l rule - a sound rule
When the negative prefix (or in fact any prefix) is added to a verb whose pronoun
prefix starts with an l-, then that l- changes to an -h-. This is a very general
pattern with only a few exceptions. Use l- when it starts a word and -h- when it
doesn't.
lonúhtehe knows
yah tehonúhtehe doesn't know
lanú=wehse he likes it
yah tehanú=wehse he doesn't like it
lotunháhehle he is happy
yah tehotunháhehle he isn't happy
24
PRONOUN SUBCLASSES
The pronoun prefixes given earlier are just a few of many that are possible. There are
fifteen subjective prefixes, about a dozen objective ones, and nearly sixty transitives. Each
of those prefixes has variations that depend on the initial sound of the verb stem. It
makes sense to classify stems both by what general class they are in (subjective,
objective, or transitive) but also by the beginning sound. Here are the subclasses listed in
the order of their frequency:
a-stemsverb stems that begin with a
c-stemsverb stems that begin with consonants (Except for a few peculiarities
 with stems that begin with y or h, it doesn't matter which consonant
 it is.)
i-stemsverb stems that begin with i
o-stemsverb stems that begin with either o or u
e-stemsverb stems that begin with either e or <
The first two subclasses are the biggest (over 80 percent of all Oneida verb stems) so
we'll concentrate on those and postpone the others until later. Here's a slightly extended
list of pronoun prefixes (still not the full list):
objective subjective
a-stem c-stem a-stemc-stem
I wak- wak- k-k-
you sa-sa-(h)s- (h)s-
helo-lo-la- la-
she yako-yako-yu- ye-
they lon-loti-lu- lati-
(The h in parentheses is only used when there's a prepronominal prefix.)
The verb stems from the previous lessons can now be identified as follows:
tell -hlo=lí transitivec-stem
ask-li÷wanu=tústransitivec-stem
parent of-y§ha transitivec-stem
grandparent of -hsotha transitivec-stem
love -nolúhkwa transitivec-stem

know -anúhte objective a-stem
live -nakehlusubjective c-stem
like -nú=wehse subjective c-stem and transitive c-stem
be happy -atunháhehleobjective a-stem
 25
Vowel drop rule - a sound rule
In general when a pronoun prefix ending in a vowel is attached to a stem
beginning in a vowel, the verb stem vowel is dropped. This is true of all
the a-stems. There are some exceptions among o-stems.

CONVERSATIONAL VOCABULARY
There are several expressions for yes. The most general word is §=<. Use it for answering
questions. For agreeing with someone you can use né= or né= wah. The word for no is
yáht<. There is also a slightly less formal word tah. For an intermediate response, you
can use khe=lé ki÷ wah which means I guess so or tat nu÷u which means maybe.

Transcribing
Converting someone's spoken language to writing is a skill that improves with practice
and knowledge. The more you know the expected sound patterns (the possible sounds, the
accent patterns, and which sounds can go together) and how the letters represent those
sounds, the better your ears can focus. The more stems and roots you learn, the easier it
is to spot them as building blocks in larger words. To transcribe any word you will
probably need to hear it repeated several times. Use your own pronunciation to provide
the speaker with feedback about whether you are hearing the word accurately. You can
ask a speaker to say the word slowly but remember unnatural slowness adds some
distortion to natural speech - rhythms, glottal stops, and h's in particular. If you do
transcribe a word spoken very slowly, make sure you also listen to it spoken at a natural
rate to verify it. If you have trouble with some detail (is that sound an h or a long
vowel; is the accent on the second or third syllable), see if you can produce the contrast
between your choices and ask the speaker to tell you which sounds better.
It is almost impossible to accurately transcribe a whispered syllable. You can often tell
that such a syllable exists but not what the sounds are. The best recourse is to listen to
 50
the unwhispered form of the same word. Since the whispered form is the one that is
natural to say in isolation, to hear the unwhispered form you'll need to hear it in a
sentence with words following it. One of the easiest ways to do this is to create a simple
yes-no question so the word you are trying to transcribe comes at the beginning of a
sentence followed by the question word k<. If that doesn't work, you might think of a
more complicated sentence as long as the word you are interested in doesn't come at the
end.
Analysis
Unless you are trying to learn Oneida word by word, when a speaker tells you a new
word, you probably want to figure out its internal structure, especially the stem it is built
on. Then you can use your knowledge of the grammar to create other words from the
same stem. This is like solving a puzzle and you often need several clues. You know
from what you've learned so far that stems get distorted in various contexts - an initial
vowel on a verb stem may have been swallowed up by a pronoun prefix (vowel drop
rule); a glottal stop or h may be missing because of an accent rule; you may not know
whether an -e- is part of a stem or an epenthetic vowel; some consonants may be part of
a noun stem or a nominalizer; and so on. Use your knowledge of these rules to help
reconstruct the stems. At times you will need to collect additional words from the
speaker. Here's an example.

14.3.1â•… Yes/no questions
14.3.1.1â•… Preliminaries
The conventional wisdom about yes/no questions, based on a long logical tradition,
has been that the speaker asking the question is neutral with respect to the expected
answer – positive or negative. That is:
 (21) Logical tradition about yes/no questions:
                 “Given proposition P, tell me, is it true or false?”
 As usual, the facts of language use are somewhat more complex, suggesting that
speakers do not ask yes/no questions with utterly neutral expectations. Rather, they
ask such questions with some initial epistemic bias toward either the affirmative or
the negative response. What is more, the speaker’s varying initial biases can be coded
by subtle variations in the grammatical form of the yes/no question. Thus in English
one finds at least the following possible variant forms of asking a yes/no question,
graded along a continuum of the speaker’s epistemic bias toward either the affirmative
or negative response:6

 Questions about the extent of adjectival predicates fall into two groups: unre-
stricted vs. restricted. Unrestricted questions probe the entire scale of the potential
answer, say from ‘very good’ to ‘good’ to ‘not so good’ to ‘bad’ to ‘very bad’. The positive
end of the scale is used to form such questions, as in English, and a negative question
form cannot be used. The WH-pronoun for this question type is the same one used for
mass-subject quantity questions in (64a) above. Thus consider:

The general form of yes/no questions in Ute involves the attachment of the interroga-
tive suffix -a(a) to the first word in the interrogative clause. Otherwise, the syntactic
difference between the declarative and interrogative clause is minimal (except for into-
nation). Thus compare:

tical, one important difference remains to be considered: the
way in which the vowel of the first syllable is connected to the
 following cluster or •contact,"" which is markedly different in the
 two caaes, 21 This fact probably kept Ariate from indicating the
 two types as identical, even though the kymographic measurements
 showed the lengths to be identical. One must keep in mind the
fact that the problem of quantity is not purely a question of length,

3SG table - LOC sit - STAT:DEP DEM
 ‘the one sitting on the table, that one’ (341) = ‘the one that’s
 sitting on the table’
The postposing strategy, then, can be seen to involve the sentence-final
demonstrative pronoun in the same way as the answer to a ‘which’ question does; it
is a grammaticization of a discourse strategy. And because the demonstrative
pronouns are case-marked for the role of the pivotal noun in the main clause, they
provide an indication of which noun in the main clause is the pivotal noun. Thus,
this postposing strategy is more transparent than the internal head strategy discussed
earlier.
6.2.3 “Free” relatives
 Free relatives are formed with a sentence-initial identifying clause which
contains an indefinite pronoun (which are the same in form as question words). As
expected, the identifying clause has both the properties of dependent clauses
mentioned above: a special verb form and lack of nominative case marking for the
subject. Here are some examples:

 6.3 Causative2
Wappo exhibits three types of causatives: suffixal, periphrastic, and prefixal.
6.3.1 The suffixal causative
There is a causative suffix in Wappo. Its form varies, as we will show in the
causative paradigms below. An epenthetic consonant appears when the root ends
with a vowel, and seems to be an optional variant otherwise. The causee is in the
unmarked (i.e., accusative) case. First we will discuss the form of the causative verb
with the causative suffix, then we will present some examples.
A. The form of suffixal causative verbs
The causative verb forms are all based on the unmarked form (Form A) of the
verb root (see section 4.3 for verb forms). As noted above, an epenthetic consonant
appears when the root ends with a vowel, and seems to be an optional variant
2. See Li and Thompson (1977) for a more typologically oriented discussion of the Wappo
causative.

Since question words are also used as indefinite pronouns, these indirect questions,
particularly those which do not express doubt, may, in appropriate contexts, also be
understood as complements with indefinite prounouns. For example, both (159) and

Wappo," 5.2 Questions
5.2.1 Yes-no questions
 Yes-no questions are signalled in Wappo by a question particle, glossed Q,
which typically occurs after the verb, thus typically clause-finally. Its form is hVʔ,
where the vowel harmonizes with the preceding vowel. Because of the vowel
harmony, it might seem appropriate to regard the question particle as a verbal suffix,
but, as will be seen just below, it can follow words from several different classes,
including verbs, nouns, and adverbs, and it harmonizes with each of them.
Therefore, we choose to represent it as a separate word. Here is a minimal pair to
illustrate the vowel harmony:
 (1) a. k'ew -i minaw - taʔhaʔ
man - NOM 2SG see - PST Q
‘did the man see you?’ (16)
 b. k'ew -i mi naw - šiʔ hiʔ
man - NOM 2SG see - DURQ
‘does the man see you?’ (16)
Here are some further examples:

‘have you finished already?’ (j3)
(3) miʔ i hak' - šeʔ heʔ
2SG:NOM 1SG like - DUR Q
‘do you like me?’ (11)
(4) may miʔ naw - ta - lahkhiʔ hiʔ

‘didn’t you see anybody?’ (23)
(5) te ceʔmi ek'a haʔ
3SG COP 2SG sonQ
‘is he your son?’ (26)
(6) miʔ te - thuma - hes - ukh hak' - šeʔheʔ
2SG:NOM 3SG - DAT DIR - give - INF want - DUR Q
‘do you want to give it to her?’ (204)
There are several conditions under which the question particle does not occur
sentence-finally. First, it is possible for a pronominal subject or an adverb to follow
the verb; in such cases the question particle is not clause-final:
(7)luče neʔ - khiʔ hiʔ miʔ
tobacco have - STAT Q 2SG:NOM
‘do you have any cigarettes?’ (14)
(8) k'eš - ila -khiʔhiʔ heta
deer - NOM missing - STAT Qhere
‘aren’t there any deer here?’ (14)
With an adverb as the focussed element, it is also possible for the question particle
to occur directly after the adverb:
92Simple Clause Types
(9) cephi athikeywiʔ hiʔ tu - leʔa - siʔ
 3SG:NOM tomorrow Q DIR - come - FUT
 ‘is she coming tomorrow?’ (73)
(10)maʔa haʔ miʔ yoʔ - khiʔ
 still Q 2SG:NOM exist - STAT
‘are you still here?’ (j99)
Finally, in a complement sentence, especially with verbs of knowing and saying, if
the questioned predicate is not sentence-final, then neither will the question particle
be:
(11)haṭis - khiʔhiʔ miʔ ithali- čal' -iš
know - STAT Q 2SG 1SG what INDEF - say - DUR:DEP
‘do you know what I’m saying?’ (169)
5.2.2 Question-word questions
A. The position and use of question words
For a predicate-final language, Wappo is unusual in having question words
typically occurring in clause-initial position, though other positions are possible
under pragmatic conditions which we have not uncovered. Thus, along with (12) a.,
we can also have (12) b. and (12) c.:
(12)a. iṭa miʔ iyok' - okh hak' - šeʔ
where 2SG:NOM 1SG sit - INF want - DUR
‘where do you want me to sit?’ (lts87)
b.miʔ iṭaiyok' - okhhak' - šeʔ
2SG:NOM where 1SG sit - INF want - DUR
‘where do you want me to sit?’ (lts87)
c.miʔ i iṭa yok' - okhhak' - šeʔ
2SG:NOM 1SG where sit - INF want - DUR
‘where do you want me to sit?’ (lts87)
This preference for clause-initial question words could be due to influence from
English.

Question words are inflected for case as are other nouns and pronouns:
(23) may - ioyok' - eʔ

 ‘who’s winning?’ (70)

 ‘what fell on the roof?’ (17)
(25) may - thumiʔokal'te - siʔ
 who - DAT 2SG:NOM talk - FUT
 ‘who are you going to talk to?’ (291)
Question words show the same distinction for alienable and inalienable possession
as do other nouns and pronouns (see section 3.3.7). Thus, as expected, for
inalienable possession, the question word is unsuffixed:
(26) may huʔ -ichip -iš - khiʔ
 who face - NOM red - INCH - STAT
 ‘whose face got red?’ (26)
while for alienable possession the question word takes the genitive suffix:
(27) ceʔeʔ may - meʔ c'ic'a
COP who - GEN bird
 ‘whose bird is that?’ (56)
 5.2 Questions 95
B. The “indefinite” prefix i-
 There is some evidence that the “indefinite” prefix i- is an old indefinite prefix,
now only partially productive. First, note that many of the question words, though
no longer morphologically analyzable, begin with i-. Second, ikhaʔ ‘how’, with an
initial i-, contrasts with ce khaʔ ‘that way’, as seen in:
 (28) thal -mamiʔce khaʔ okal' - iʔ
 what - BENEF 2SG:NOM DEM waytalk - DUR
 ‘why do you talk that way?’ (18)
Third, for at least two verbs, there is a contrast between a form prefixed with i- and
one without i-, kham- ‘do’ and hah- ‘say’, whose prefixed form is inexplicably
ičhah-. Thus compare the prefixed and unprefixed forms in the a. and b. examples
below.

Golin," Clefts are important in Yimas because they play a central role in content questions,
 otherwise known as wh questions. Note that in questions like Who sheared the sheep? or
 What did he shear the sheep with?, the action of shearing the sheep is presupposed and
 established and what is at issue is who did the action or what was used to perform it. Thus,
 the pragmatic force of the non-wh component of these questions is identical to that of a
 relative clause in a cleft, and so it is really no surprise that some wh questions in Yimas take
 the forms of clefts. If the wh word is functioning as S, then a cleft construction is
 obligatory; to use an ordinary clause structure is ungrammatical. (Foley 1991:430).

DAT recorder and the other on a Sony Walkman cassette recorder. During these class
sessions anyone was free to ask questions, suggest analyses etc. In the pair sessions

17.1.3 CONTENT QUESTIONS USING THE HEO FOCUS MARKER
Content questions are those which expect a content word or words as an answer. It was
shown in Section 11.7 that if a content question employs a focus construction, the focus
marker used will be the heo focus marker. The heo focus marker in questions works as
in focus constructions, but the element it is questioning is the element it expresses focus
on, using the agreement system outlined in Chapter 11.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Questions and negation
This chapter takes as its starting point the semantic fields of questions and negation and
looks at the kinds of constructions used to express them. The expression of questions
and negation in Lavukaleve involves some use of focus constructions, as well as other
syntactic strategies not involving morphologically-marked focus.
Questions are expressed in one of two main ways: either by using a specific question-
word, or by just using a focus construction. Even those clauses using specific question
words are frequently expressed using focus constructions.
There are various ways to negate different kinds of constituents: including the Negative
verbal suffix -la, the particle tamu ÔnoÕ; the intransitive verb tave Ôbe notÕ; the negative
imperative expressed by the Admonitive suffix; and other negative lexical items.
Frequently, negative predications are expressed using a focus construction. The use of
focus constructions in the areas of questions and negation is a very characteristic feature
of Lavukaleve, and indeed of other languages which have grammaticalised focus
structures.
The first part of this chapter discusses the syntactic structures used to express questions,
and also all the interrogative lexical items in the language. It also discusses how positive
and negative polar questions are answered. The second part of the chapter presents a
discussion of all aspects of negation, including the role of the focus markers in negative
clauses. The morphological, syntactic and pragmatic features of focus constructions are
discussed in Chapter 11.
17.1 QUESTIONS
In Lavukaleve, questions are very often phrased using a focus construction. There are
407
17 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION
also a number of question words which may be used, either in a focus construction or
not. All questions are marked, not only by syntactic and lexical means, but also by a
distinctive rising intonation. Questions can be divided into two functional and syntactic
types: polar questions and content questions.
As was shown in Section 11.7, there are three focus markers in Lavukaleve: feo, the
default focus marker; meo, the focus marker used in polar questions; and heo, the focus
marker used, among other things, in content questions. See the above-mentioned
chapter for a full discussion of the focus markers and their syntactic and semantic
functions.
The sole use of the meo focus marker, then, is in marking focus in polar questions.
Content questions usually use a question word, usually with a focus marker. If the focus
marker is present, it is heo, and it agrees with the questioned item. The following
sections discuss in turn polar questions and then content questions.
17.1.1 P OLAR QUESTIONS
Polar questions are framed using a focus construction involving the meo focus marker,
with the focus marker agreeing with the questioned element. Since questioned elements
are focussed, by definition, one would expect questions to be expressed using morpho-
syntactically marked focus in a language in which this is available, and this is indeed
what happens in Lavukaleve. Some examples (there are many more in Section 11.7):
Questioning an NP:
1)Vo'voul honalariminal?
vo'vou-lhonala-ri minala
boy(m)-du MOD.PROX.dum-PSNV 3dumQFOC

 2sg- eat -NEG-sgm3sgmQFOC 3sgmO-SBD-say -ANT
 ""Wow. The giant here didn't eat you?"" [one of the men] said. mn2 057
Example (4) shows that the meo focus marker can be used with a negative clause.
Section 17.1.2 explains how the answers to these and other questions are phrased.
Note that the focus marker does not move to the initial position in questions; rather, it
remains in the position in which it would be if the sentence were not a question. There
are a couple of examples in which the focus marker appears in initial position. For
instance:
5) Minungakalaona neanoaemna
 minunga- kala o- na neano ae-m na
 2sgQFOC 1sgPOSS- mother(f)3sgfO- in disparagement(m) go.up-sgm sgmArt

 3sgmEFOC 3sgfO- take.out -NF 3sgfO- leave -NF go -sgmsgmArt 3sgmEFOC
 Was it you (m) who was cruel to my mother, putting her there and leaving her and going?
 gm 102
This is not an example of movement of the focus marker, as there is no other place in
the sentence where the focus marker would be expected to be. Rather, it is an example
of ellipsis of the argument with which the focus marker is in construction; inu Ôyou
(2sg)Õ. This, and another sentence structurally almost identical to it from the same story,
is the only example of such ellipsis in the corpus. It is not clear whether the possibility
is to do with the fact that the sentence is a question.
Incidentally, this is also one of the rare examples of a focus-echo construction using the
meo focus marker. Note that the second (and third, in fact) focus markers agree in
gender and number but not person with the first. See Section 11.5.1 for an explanation
of focus-echo constructions.
17.1.2 A NSWERS TO POLAR QUESTIONS
Polar questions can be phrased both positively and negatively, as the examples above
have shown. Positive answers to positive polar questions are expressed by iire ÔyesÕ.
Negative answers to positive questions are expressed by tamu ÔnoÕ. The particle comes
first, in its own sentence intonation unit, then a longer sentential answer may follow.
For example the answer to the question in (2) Is it here you want to stay? is as follows:
 409
17 - Q UESTIONS AND NEGATION

As the example shows, positive answers to negative questions are expressed with the
negative particle.
Even though negative questions expect a positive answer, it is possible to give a
negative answer to a negative question. This is done using a particle oman Ôon the
contraryÕ. A negative answer to the above question (Q: The giant didnÕt eat you? A:
The giant ate me (which would only make sense if the boy was now a ghost for
example)) could be expressed in the following way, using oman and a positive

THE HEO FOCUS MARKER
There are two uses of heo. One is automatic on the choice of certain syntactic elements;
the other is to express strong emphasis. There are some syntactic environments which
require the use of heo. These environments are: content questions, the second focus
marker of a focus-echo construction, focus clauses which contain a foia demonstrative
pronoun, and focus clauses in which a constituent is emphasised using the emphatic
particle ta. In these environments, if any focus marker is used it must be heo rather than
meo or feo. In other environments, heo may be used to express strong emphasis. This
is particularly the case with contrastive emphasis, which is almost always expressed using
heo. For this pragmatic purpose, feo may be always used instead of heo, but if it is, the
strong emphasis reading associated with heo will be lost.
· Content questions
Heo contrasts with meo in that while they are both used to form questions, meo is only
used in polar questions and heo is only used in content questions. Compare the two
focus markers in the example below, which is taken from natural conversation. The
speaker was trying to make out the identity of a dark figure approaching the house one
night:

Questions phrased positively are neutral as to whether they expect a positive or negative
answer. However questions phrased negatively expect a positive answer. For example
the question in (4) above The giant here didnÕt eat you? was asked when a boy
reappeared in his village after a long absence. The village people had assumed he had
been eaten by the giant, but seeing him they realised he must not have been, and thus
asked the question knowing that it would receive a positive answer: the giant had not
eaten him. The boyÕs answer is as follows:

Santa,"Apart from -la (shared with Bonan), Santa seems to preserve a trace of the Proto-
Mongolic plural formative *.s in the single lexicalized example of kewon ‘son’ : kewo.si
‘child’. In this word, the stress does not fall on the last syllable, as is usual, but rather on
the penultimate syllable, suggesting the possibility that it is a question of two separate
words: kewo si, with si acting as a particle. The element (.)si (shared in this shape with
Mangghuer) occurs also in the complex suffix .si-la, which pluralizes pronouns and kin-
ship terms, notably kewon ‘son’ : kewo.si-la ‘sons’ (or: ‘children’), tere ‘he’ : tere.si-la
‘they’. Another suffix with a similar function is .xie (possibly a variant of .si, but cer-
tainly also influenced by Chinese xie ‘some’), which can further be expanded into .xie-la,
e.g. gayijio ‘younger brother’ : gayijio.xie(-la) ‘younger brothers’.

Santa," Negation is expressed by several Common Mongolic negative particles. In the finite
conjugation, three preverbal negative particles are used: ulie (< *ülü) for the durative and
progressive forms, ese (< *ese) for the terminative, and bu (< *bUU ) for the imperatives.
e.g. bi maghashi ulie echi-ne ‘I won’t go tomorrow’, bi ese ijie-wo ‘I have not eaten
yet’, kieme-de bu kielie ‘do not tell anyone!’. In equational clauses, the particle pushi
(< *bisi) is used, e.g. bi laoshi pushi wo ‘I am not a teacher’. In possessive clauses,
negation is expressed by using the negative existential uwo ~ wiwo (< *ügei), e.g. made
kewon uwo ‘I do not have a son’. There are some indications that the negative existential
may synchronically have been reanalysed as the terminative form of a hypothetical
negative verb u- ~ wi- (term. u-wo ~ wi-wo), though the occurrence of the terminative
in this construction is certainly somewhat unexpected.
LEXICON
Although the grammatical structures and the majority of all lexical items in Santa are
clearly Mongolic in origin, the Santa lexicon has undergone massive influence from
other languages. Most notably, Chinese loanwords occur in nearly every area of Santa
vocabulary. A survey of the 10,145 items in the largest extant collection of Santa words
(Ma & Chen) shows that 61 per cent of all items are Mongolic and 34 per cent Chinese
(including partial borrowings, mostly verbal roots), while the remaining 5 per cent derive
from Arabic, Persian, Turkic, and Tibetan.

Santa,"The quality [] occurs mainly after the uvular consonants kh gh in complementary
distribution with i, suggesting that it should be interpreted as an allophone of i.
Diachronically [] seems to represent the original back vowel *ï, e.g. ghimusun
[mus] ‘thumb’ < *qïmusu/n ‘fingernail’, khidei [qdei] ‘Han Chinese’ < *qïta-.
After a medial gh, the quality [] can be replaced by [], e.g. eghi- [] ‘to hit’ (possibly
from *orkï- ‘to throw’). Another position in which the quality [], or perhaps more often
[ ], is attested, is before a nasal coda in non-initial syllables; in these cases, it seems to

be a question of an allophone of e, e.g. amen [am ] ‘millet’ < *amu/n, banden [b d ]
‘stool’ (from Chinese). After the dental sibilants s z c and the retroflexes sh zh ch r, the
vowel i is pronounced with a sibilant resp. retroflex coarticulation, e.g. bosi [bus ]
‘cloth’ < *bös, zisi [dz s ] ‘selfish’ (from Chinese), zhighon [d u] ‘six’ < *jirguxa/n,
chi [t] ‘you’< *ci, shire [ ] ‘desk’ < *sirexe. These pronunciations are obviously

Santa,"The most idiosyncratic feature of the Santa conjugational system is the optional and
apparently not yet fully grammaticalized marking of subject number in the finite verb.
The singular number is unmarked, but the plural number of the subject can be indicated
on the verb by adding the marker .ndu-, which is formally identical with the reciprocal
voice suffix (*.ldU-) of verbal derivation. In its original use, this suffix expresses the reci-
procity of action (‘each other’), as in matang ghuala bang ji.ndu-ye ‘let us wrestle
(with each other)’, but in Santa it is more commonly used in a cooperative function
(‘together’). The ongoing grammaticalization of the verbal plural marker obviously
started from the latter function, and synchronically it is still a question of a derivational
category, e.g. ta ijie ~ ta ijie.ndu ‘you (many) eat (together)!’.

encountered in derivational processes, as in shira ‘yellow’ : shira.la- ‘to become yellow’
vs. chizhe ‘flower’ : chizhe.lie- ‘to bloom’. Apparently, it is no longer a question of
a synchronically productive phenomenon.

6.1.3 Tight Sentences
 Tight sentences are those sentences which encode a limited range of semantic relationships between their
constituent bases. There are fifteen types of tight sentences in Wand Tuan. These are described in this section in
alphabetical order.
Alternative Sentence (AltS)
 The Alternative Sentence is composed of two obligatory bases joined by an obligatory Link. The Link and
Base2 may be repeated. Both bases may be manifested by a clause or a sentence recursed into that base. In addition,
Base2 may be manifested by only segi ‘Neg’, thus expressing an elliptical negation of the predicate manifesting
Base1. Link is always manifested by o ‘or’. The alternative turns on one point of difference between the
predications of Base1 and Base2. The alternation may encode either excluded middle or included middle.

4.4.3 Content Questions (Ex. 11–18)
Content questions are questions which require something other than yes/no answers (see 3.2.3.2). The
information required is signalled in English by a question word such as ―Who?,‖ ―What?,‖ ―When?,‖ etc. In
Kuna, there are three types of content questions: amplificatory questions, topic-establishing questions, and
confirmation questions.
4.4.3.1 Amplificatory questions
Amplificatory questions are asked about a topic that may be already under discussion, or so obvious that it
requires no introduction. Most of the time, more information is being sought about the action referred to in the
discussion at hand. For example, the questioner may want to know who did the action, or when the action
happened. In dealing with amplificatory questions, two things must be remembered: the intonation pattern of
the question and the formation of the question.
1) Intonation pattern of amplificatory questions
Amplificatory questions have a characteristic intonation pattern. Do the following exercise to familiarize
yourself with this pattern.

Kuna,"Someone calls you home for something.
11.4.8 Obligatory answers to questions and proposals
Kuna tends to be more explicit than English/Spanish. A real question must be answered or a proposal responded
to by the listener before he can pose a counter question or counter proposal. The listener, however, is allowed to
ask for further information or clarification before answering the main question or proposal.

 Fourth part: Sentences
2.19 Introduction
A sentence is an utterance consisting of one or more free word units and possibly
one or more bound word units, and usually being marked as complete by an intona-
tion contour, which typically runs from high pitch and strong stress to relatively low
pitch and weak stress. In the case of questions the intonation of a sentence may go
up again near the end, which may be taken as a sign that the sentence needs a sequel,
i.e. an answer. A written version of a sentence typically ends in a period, or, in case
of a question, a question mark (e.g.: I have done a lot of work today. Where have
you been?).
",0,Interrogative verb morphology,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is stated that ""In the case of questions the intonation of a sentence may go up again near the end, which may be taken as a sign that the sentence needs a sequel, i.e. an answer."" This suggests that the language described in the grammar forms polar questions using interrogative intonation only. Therefore, the answer is ""Interrogative intonation only"".",Interrogative intonation only,1,0,questions in general
Carib," A more recent description of Venezuelan Carib in which both Mosonyi brothers were
involved is Mosonyi, Mosonyi and Medina Tamanaico 2000. In this publication, the endan-
germent of the Carib language in Venezuela, noticeable in recent publications by others, can-
not be recognized in the Carib language material, since the authors maintain the phonological
and morphological analysis presented in Mosonyi 1978 and 1982 and the sample texts are
taken from a 1982 publication (Medina Tamanaico and Mosonyi 1982). However, the authors
recognize the decline of the Carib language in their statement that a lack of motivation to
speak the Carib language is quite common among young people (p. 399).
28
 A periphrastic construction is used instead. For example, senetake ‘I’ll see him/her/it’ is
expressed in Venezuelan Carib by enery ỳwa man ‘he/she/it is for me to see’, i.e. ‘I’ll see
him/her/it’. This construction may also occur in the other dialects, where, however, it means
‘I have to see him/her/it’ rather than ‘I’ll see him/her/it’.

 In Surinamese Carib, the word kynkanon (‘he says’) is often pronounced as not much more
than [(ŋ)gano(ŋ)] when it is not sentence initial. This fact supports the interpretation of the
Venezuelan Carib word nükaano here as the allegation form kynkano(n), instead of the uncer-
tainty form nykano(n). Note that the uncertainty form is appropriate for a question, but inap-
propriate for an allegation (see 2.10.5).

2.5.6Hiatus
When a hiatus occurs, i.e. when two consecutive vowels in a word belong to differ-
ent syllables, the first vowel is written with a grave accent, unless the second vowel
is followed by a coda plosive, also being represented by a grave accent (see 2.5.8;
cf. wèi ‘I have been’, but eìpa rather than èìpa ‘not being’). The fact that a coda plo-
sive, or at least an allophone of it, and a hiatus have the same pronunciation (i.e. [Ɂ])
suggests using the same symbol. For example, apart from some difference in vowel
length due to the presence or absence of a syllable coda, the only difference in pro-
nunciation between àa ‘yes’ and àna ‘we’ is [n]. Of course, a grave accent repre-
senting a coda plosive always precedes a consonant (as in àna), and a grave accent
representing a hiatus always precedes a vowel (as in àa).

5.1.3. Exclusive reference
In section (4.7.2.), reference was made to the occurrence of “incompatible”
combination of the inclusive pronoun with exclusive cross-reference marking
was noticed:
(1100)tja'nã ƭle'le-a-xa-ki
we.INtogether-1P-AS-DEC
‘we are together (married/brother-sister/kin)’
(1101)txa'nã / tsi'tsİǊ'ce-a-xa-hͿ-ki arǊi-'du-a-xa-ta
we.IN/ we.EX trap-1P-AS-NOM-DEC tapir-BER-1P-AS-CSO
‘(it is) we who made a trap for a tapir’
It is unclear what the function of these “incompatible” combinations is. One
could imagine that (1100) has an affective connotation, or that the exclusion of
the hearer is emphasised. Or maybe the examples reflect evasive use of the dis-
tinction, i.e. one tries to avoid to be specific. The choice between pronouns in
(1101) is not problematic as far as the nature of interrogative context is re-
garded: this utterance was the answer to a question and the person who asked
the question is by definition excluded from the proposition, because otherwise
he would not have asked. Note that the combination of exclusive tsitsİ with in-
clusive -a- inflexion tends to be considered really ungrammatical, so there is an
asymmetry:
Table 24. Compatibility of inclusive and exclusive reference
IN: -a-EX: -axa-

The fact that only the exclusive was accepted in:

we.EX beat-1P-AS-DEC
‘we’re hitting (him)’
whereas: *tjana mͅ?axaki and *tjana mͅ?aki were rejected altogether, can be
explained by pragmatic anomaly, as here it could be argued that it is very un-
usual to make a remark “we’re beating him up” to a participant in the action. It
is more natural to utter this phrase to a bystander, e.g. as an answer to his or her
questions about what is going on.

Kwaza,"7.1. Negation 527
7.1.1.4. Negation in different moods
Negation in the declarative and interrogative moods is relatively transparent.
The negative morpheme is generally inserted in a position before the mood
marker without any further adaptations:
(2796)ja-'he-da-ki
eat-NEG-1S-DEC
‘I did not eat’
Questions can be asked in a negative form, and a negative response yields a
logically positive answer:
(2797)Q: mãrİ̘ri'tsa ja-'he-xa-re A: hã'?ã (ja)-'he-da-ki
person eat-NEG-2-INTyes eat-NEG-1S-DEC
‘do(n’t) you eat people?’ ‘no’

‘is it very heavy?’ ‘yes (it is)’
(2799)Q: atsile-'he-tsy-reA: ha'?ã
heavy-NEG-GER-INT yes
‘isn’t it very heavy?’‘yes (it isn’t)’
Person-negative order also occurs in the interrogative. It questions a nega-
tive presupposition held by the speaker:
(2800)ƭ-'wã 'rai?ͿhͿ mã=duhͿ-ty-a-'ni=xa-he-reͅrjãwã-'na

‘why don’t you wait for (the fruit) to ripen?’
The following example of a countersupposition is formally interrogative, but
not semantically. The interrogative is used emphatically here:
303.Note that the glossing of -ni as exhortative represents a literal interpretation of a con-
 struction that may be also analysed as causational (like in the next example).

Kwaza,"There may be originally a relation between ellipsis and compounding. In
verbal compounds, the first member does not bear inflexion:
(3115) darje=hyhy'rwa-ki
 strong=move-DEC
 ‘it is walking fast’
In section (6.2.4.1.) the omission of verbal inflexion was considered as one
of the ways to form adverbs. In the following example the verb root txu'hǊi- is
probably not compounded with the next verb root, but used as an independent
adverb:
(3116) txu'hǊi horo-'ra
 littlecut.up-IMP
 ‘take a little bit of it!’
Ellipsis of verbal inflexion was also encountered as a way to express coor-
dination, as an alternative to cosubordinative marking. This will be described at
the end of section (8.5.).
7.5.2. Ellipsis of roots
The omission of verb roots is much more common than omission of verb in-
flexion. Because this makes utterances rather unspecific literally, their inter-
pretation depends heavily on the speech context. Consequently, root ellipsis
occurs frequently in dialogues, as a minimal response to questions, remarks or

comments. Several characteristic properties of Kwaza grammar may have
emerged originally from root ellipsis.
7.5.2.1. Elliptic responses
As an answer to a yes/no question a root may be omitted (note that the main
stress of elliptic responses usually falls on the first syllable):
(3117) Q: ku'ro-xa-xa-re A: 'a-xa-ki

 ‘did you close the door?’ ‘we did’

Also, verbal roots of commands or of responses to commands and exhortations
may be omitted:

vowel of the second syllable is often long.

‘he (said he) is going to eat again’‘let him!’, ‘it’s O.K.!’

tative morpheme -ni and the part ƭ- to the pronoun ƭ ‘he’.

 Mekens employs two systems of expressing short answers to questions: the
echo—system used for affirmative answers and the yes-no system used for negative
short answers. The former simply repeats the verb of the question in an affirmative
answer; while the latter uses a special negative particle ‘nop’ or a combination o f the
negative particle plus the pronoun ot T , when the questioned addressee is directly
involved in the proposition. One particularity of short answers to questions in Mekens is
that the object of a transitive verb is frequently omitted, even though there is a strong
 requirement for the object to be overtly marked otherwise (cf. sections 3.3). The pairs of
sentences below show the two systems of short answers. In (24a—a’) there is a pair of
 question and affirmative answer, and in (24b—b”) a pair of question and negative
 answer. Examples (20b’-b”) above have already illustrated possible forms of answers to
 yes-no questions focusing on one element of the proposition.

 However, yes—no questions may also focus on one element of the sentence. In
 this case, only the focused constituent is interrogated, the remainder of the proposition
 is presupposed. In such focused yes—no questions, the focused constituent occurs in
 focus position, sentence initially, marked with the focus particle ‘re’. The non-assertive
 particle follows the focus marker5. This use of yes-no questions may still elicit a regular
 positive or negative response, but a contrastive answer is generally found in response to
 such questions. The examples in (20a—b) show a contrastive or focused yes—no
 questions. (20b’-b”) illustrate the type of response that focused yes-no questions may
 elicit from the addressee.

 Alternative questions are formally related to yes-no questions. They are also
formed with the non-assertive particle ‘kera.' The sentences in (26a-c) below illustrate
the different forms of alternative questions, depending on which constituent is
questioned and/or given as alternative. In (26a) two whole sentences are given as
alternatives, thus the question consists of two juxtaposed regular yes-no questions. The
two juxtaposed questions have the same intonation pattern of two independent yes—no
questions, that is, a final rising intonation contour. (26b) focuses on the object of the
dependent clause; the alternatives are listed in the focus sentence-initial position,
followed by the focus and the non-assertive particles. In (26c) on the other hand, the
focus of the question is on the subject. In this case, a regular subject focus information
question of the type ‘who does X?’ is followed by the two alternative choices, which are
themselves framed as simple yes-no questions. We should note that each of the

 The final mood category parallels the polar interrogative in form but its clitic is =sh rather than =s`.
Both moods communicate a lack of knowledge on the part of the speaker but, whereas the polar
interrogative elicits the information from the addressee, the dubitative only expresses the lack of knowledge
or certainty. Indeed, this form is often used in response to a question to express an inability to provide the
requested information.

come under the scope of the question mood particle, as in (425). Here, the speaker is asking the addressee

with the question words within the medial clause and the WH-question mood clitic on the final verb, is
comparable to (400).

Apurinã," The basic intonation pattern, associated with statements, is low and level until the last
accented syllable in the utterance, when it goes up with the stress and then down again.
Incomplete sentences or complete sentences conveying uncertainty, are signaled by a similar
intonation pattern except that the pitch does not come down. Interrogations signaled by
interrogative pronouns start with a high pitch and glide down to a low pitch at the end of the
utterance. If no interrogative pronoun is used, a question is signaled by the statement pattern but
with a more pronounced pitch rise on the accented syllable. Exclamations and calling involve a
 4
very high pitch on the last syllable and lengthening of the last vowel by several moras. Sentence
stress may also occur on a point that the speaker is emphasizing; it introduces a rise in pitch at
that point without obliterating the distinguishing features of the various intonation patterns.

intonation to mark polar questions can, nevertheless, be characterized as a
grammaticalized property of interrogative sentences. In (112), the first two examples
(112a-b) illustrate polar questions for clauses with transitive verbs, and the two last

Nivkh,"22.8 The suffix -lo/-l
This suffix is a marker of the interrogative verb form if there is no interrogative word in
the question. The variant -lo sounds more polite, the form -l having an unceremonious
colouring. This suffix corresponds to -la of Group B with the same meaning (see 23.5):
 (272) If p‘rə-lo/p‘rə-l?
                 s/he come-q/come-q
                 ‘Did he come?’
22.9 The suffix -di
Its meaning is interrogative with the purpose of obtaining agreement or permission to
perform an action:
 (273) Ñi ţ‘e-rχp‘rə-di?
                I you:sg-dat/add come-q:perms
                 ‘May I come to see you, please?’
22.10 The suffix -ilu/-jlu
The meaning is a rhetorical question which is in fact a negation. A reply is not neces-
sary here. In any case, it cannot begin with “yes” or “no”.
 (274) If p‘rə-jlu?
                 he come-neg
                 ‘Will he really come?’ (= He will not come, he is that kind of man).
22.11 The suffix -rla, -tla4
The distribution of these variants is analogous to that of converbal forms in -r and -t
(see Table 2 in 14.1 and (57)). The desiderative suffix -inə-/-jnə-/-ijnə- in predicates
with this suffix has the meaning of the future tense. The meaning of -rla, -tla is that of

Kham,"302 14 Non-declarative speech acts
 Lyons (1977:755) observes that it is not essential to the nature of questions to always
require an answer. That they normally obtain an answer, he says, is due to conventional
expectations. He goes on to make a distinction between ‘asking’ a question and ‘posing’
a question. Asking is more complex in that it includes an indication that the posed
question requires a response, and also necessarily assumes that the addressee knows the
answer. The distinction works well for Kham. The difference between direct and
indirect questions is essentially the same as the one between Lyon’s ‘asked’ and ‘posed’
questions – a difference that rests on the requirement of an answer.
14.1.1 Direct questions
Direct questions imply that the speaker has some kind of personal investment in the
situation being questioned, and, as a result, has a right to the information. The direct
question makes its demand by virtue of the interlocutor’s relationship to the action, or
by his/her position of authority to ask such a question. Used incorrectly the question
sounds rude and presumptuous.2
 i. Direct content questions (see §9.3)
Content questions provide us with a good example of the speaker involvement implicit
in direct questions. It is not the question word itself that makes for a direct question, but
the paradigmatic form of the verb. (Content questions occur also in indirect form, as we
shall later see.) Consider the following:
(1)kana n˙-ba-zya
 where 2S-go-CONT (DIRECT)‘Where are you going?’
(2)kata j˙i-wa
 what make-3S :PFV (DIRECT) ‘What did s/he make?’
Both questions imply more than idle curiosity. A possible context for (1), for example,
might be that a mother has given orders to her son to go fetch firewood, and now when
she sees him, his actions seem counter to what was ordered. The question, then, asks
the son to give an account of his actions. Utterance (2) implies that the speaker wants
specific details; details like ‘Name the object! (I had a contract for such and such).’ The
same questions in indirect form do not have the same force (see the contrastive examples
in 8 and 9).
",0,Interrogative verb morphology,"The information provided in the paragraph does not mention the strategy of forming polar questions used in the language described in the grammar. Therefore, the answer is ""Not enough information."".",Not enough information,0,0,content questions
Kham," In addition to ‘what’ and ‘where’ illustrated above, other content question words are
the following:
(4)su:‘who?’
 karao‘why?’
 kh˙rk˙ ‘when?’
 kitao‘how? (in what condition)’
 k˙i j˙id˙‘how? (by what method)’
 kha: ‘how much?’
All of these question words combine with numerous locative and temporal suffixes to
form a host of complex question words. A full, paradigmatic treatment of these was
given in §9.3, and will not be repeated here.
ii. Direct yes-no questions
Yes-no questions, like content questions, can be cast as direct or indirect. As with
content questions, direct yes-no questions imply a higher level of speaker involvement
in the situation than do indirect ones. Also, typical of yes-no questions is their focus on
the entire event rather than on a particular referent specified by a question word like
‘what,’ ‘who,’ or ‘where’:
(5)DIRECT:
 a. ≥a-gohr ma-b˙n˙i-wa
 my-plow INTRG-fix-3S :PFV ‘Did he fix my plow?’
 b. ≥a-s˙ n˙-ma-ba-ke
 I-ASC 2S-INTRG -go-FUT‘Will you go with me?’
3
Recall from §5.5.1 that with the interrogative ma- and with question words, the interpretation of
tense reverses in a kind of flip-flop; -ya (the usual future) indicates perfective and -ke (the usual
perfective) indicates future.
",1,Interrogative verb morphology,"Based on the given paragraph, the language described uses ""Interrogative verb morphology"" as its strategy for forming polar questions (also called yes-no questions). The paragraph provides examples of direct yes-no questions formed using verb morphology such as ""did he fix"" and ""will you go."".",Interrogative verb morphology,0,0,
Kham," The direct yes-no question in Kham is apparently an ellipted form of the full alternative
question, selecting only the half marked by negation.3 This, in the modern language, has
developed into the ‘direct’ yes-no question and occurs only in the regular, non-nominalized
paradigm. Questions with presuppositional bias, the so-called ‘tag questions,’ occur
only in the nominalized paradigm, with or without a negative marker according to
whether the presupposition is negative or positive. This means, then, that ma- has only
a negative interpretation in the nominalized paradigm, but either a negative or interrogative
interpretation in the regular paradigm depending on other factors. We will explore those
factors next.
5.5.1Ma- in the regular paradigm
Where ma- co-occurs in the regular, non-nominalized paradigm with certain tense/aspect
markers, it can have only an interrogative interpretation. In still other environments ma-
can have only a negative interpretation, and in all other environments it can have either.
",0,Interrogative verb morphology,"According to the paragraph from the descriptive grammar, the language described in it has an ""Interrogative verb morphology"" strategy of forming polar questions.",Interrogative verb morphology,0,0,polar questions
Kham," Lack of involvement, of course, is not the only possible motivation for the indirect
form of a question. It is generally agreed that one of the primary motivations for
indirectness is politeness (see Lakoff 1973, Brown and Levinson 1978, Searle 1979).
Brown and Levinson talk about ‘negative-politeness’ as a strategy for softening the
effects of certain ‘face threatening acts’ of illocution. A tension exists between wanting
to go on record on the one hand, and to avoid imposing on the other. A compromise is
reached in language by what they call ‘conventionalized indirectness.’ Indirectness is
achieved by apologies, with hedges on the illocutionary force of the act, with imperson-
alizing mechanisms, and with other softening mechanisms that give the addressee an
‘out,’ a face-saving line of escape. Thus, the questions in (8-9) may still be real requests
for information, but with softened intrusiveness or feigned non-involvement in the affairs
of the addressee.
ii. Indirect yes-no questions
In indirect form, yes-no questions can occur with positive or negative presuppositions
(which is not generally true of direct yes-no questions, though an exception can be
found in 7). The speaker himself makes a positive or negative assumption about a
particular state of affairs and then, in effect, asks for a confirmation of whether his
assumption is correct or not. Moravcsik (1971:46) suggests that the underlying structure
of this kind of a yes-no question contains a ‘copy of the suggested answer.’ The
following yes-no questions illustrate the principle. Notice the new interrogative marker
ro associated with indirect yes-no questions:
(10) n˙-re: o-ba-oro
your-husband 3S-go-NML TAG
‘Your husband left?’ (It appears he did; am I right?)
(11) n˙-re: o-ma-ba-oro
your-husband 3S-NEG -go-NML TAG
‘Didn’t your husband leave?’ (It appears he didn’t; am I right?)
30614 Non-declarative speech acts
These two sentences contrast with the direct form (which is without presupposition):
n˙-re: ma-ba-ya ‘Did your husband go or not?’ (I need to know.)
 A potential problem exists for indirect questions set in future time. The future -ya
does not occur in the indirect paradigm. To compensate for its lack, future time can be
marked in the indirect paradigm by the prospective aspect -rih, as in (12). Repeated use
in a specialized niche like this allows new forms to gain in currency.
(12) pa~îh z˙ n˙-ra-khem-rih-zya-oro
 all EMP 2S-3P -finish-PROS-CONT-NML TAG
 ‘Are you going to finish them all off?’
 Future yes-no questions can also be cast in the infinitive, especially when the aspectual
notions of time and intent are generic, as in:
(13) kata t˙-ke:-wa b˙ ma-ya-nyaro
 what one-bit-APPRX even NEG-give-INF TAG
 ‘What? (You) won’t even give (me) a small piece?’
 In natural speech, the interrogative marker ro can be missing from indirect questions.
Intonation is of little help here, since the interrogative and declarative both occur with
sentence-final falling intonation. What does disambiguate the two are the extra-linguistic
dynamics of the situation – the interrogative will invariably be spoken with a slightly
different body gesture, like a questioning turn of the eyes toward the addressee. Where
such signals are not possible, of course, the speaker will mark the question with ro, as in
the following:
(14) u-zihm-dao-ba-zya-o (with ‘ro’ OR a questioning gesture)
 his-house-ALLT 3S-go-CONT-NML TAG
 ‘He’s going home, is he?’
 iii. Equative yes-no questions
Recall from the discussion in §11.2 that there is no equative verb in Kham – the
equative is composed of two juxtaposed NPs. There is, however, a negative equative
marker (copula) ma:hk˙ which occurs at the end of the clause in negative equatives.
Where an equative clause is part of a yes-no question, the interrogative marker ro occurs
after the final NP, or after the negative copula in a negative equative, as in the following:
(15) saco n~ï: nepali ro
 true you Nepali TAG
 ‘Are you really a Nepali?
(16) ao ≥a: ≥a-j˙i-wo ma:hk˙ ro
 this I 1S-make-NML notTAG
 ‘Didn’t I make this?’/‘Am I not the maker of this?’
14.1 Direct and indirect questions 307
In (15), the two juxtaposed NPs are ‘you’ and ‘Nepali,’ while in (16) they are ‘this’ and
‘that which was made by me.’ A literal rendition of (16) would be: ‘Is not this that
which was made by me?’
iv. Indirect alternative questions
Indirect alternative questions differ from yes-no questions only in their degree of explica-
tion. In direct yes-no questions the alternative ‘or not’ is not expressed.4 In what I call
an ‘alternative question,’ on the other hand, the alternative is expressed. The two halves
are joined by the alternative marker s˙~î meaning ‘or,’ as in the following:
(17) kwao-r˙i-zya-o s˙~î o-ma-r˙i-zya-o
 clothing 3S-bring-CONT -NML or 3S-NEG -bring-CONT-NML
 ‘Is s/he bringing clothing or is s/he not bringing clothing?’
The construction is obviously cumbersome and rarely used, especially since it can be
expressed more expeditiously in the following:
(18) kwama-r˙i-zya-o
 clothing INTRG-bring-CONT -3S (DIRECT)
 ‘Is s/he bringing clothing or not?’
Alternative questions do, however, occur rather frequently in an infinitive form, as in:
(19) zya-nya s˙~î ma-zya-nya
 eat-INF or NEG-eat-INF
 ‘(Are you going to) eat or not?’ / ‘(Should I) eat or not?
Furthermore, the alternation can be between NP arguments, and not in the eventuality
named by the verb. Example (20) illustrates this:
(20) ao s˙~î ho: o-cahi-zya-o
 this or that 3S-need-CONT-NML ‘Does he need this or that?’
14.1.3 Rhetorical questions
The form of a rhetorical question is the same as that of a real question. The two
question types differ in their communicative intent. Rhetorical questions are not requests
for information, per se, but have an additional intent of imparting information – often
some kind of negative value judgement. Most rhetorical questions are in the indirect
form, though not exclusively. Following is a direct form:

In hundreds of pages of text I have only one occurrence of an alternative question in direct form.

 Notice that whereas ya- occurred as a 3RD plural object in the regular paradigm, it
occurs as a 3RD plural subject in the nominalized paradigm. The same is true for ni-,
the dual form. This polysemy results in a number of word level ambiguities, such as the
following:

5.5Negative and interrogative marking
The Kham negative and what I will call the ‘direct interrogative’ have homophonous
forms – the prefix ma-. There is good evidence to suggest that they both derive from the
same etymon *ma, the PTB negative marker. Yes-no questions are a specific kind of
alternative question; one in which the scope of possible answers is limited in choice to
one of two alternatives, either positive or negative. The form of the full yes-no question,
then, is along the order of Did he do X or did he not do X? with a negative marker
occurring on the second alternative. It is also telling that both negative ma- and interrogative
ma- occur in the same prefixal slot, between 1ST/2ND subjects and 3RD objects.
",1,Interrogative verb morphology,"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the strategy of forming polar questions (yes-no questions) in the described language is through the use of a negative marker occurring on the second alternative. Therefore, the answer is ""Negative marking"".
Choose one of the four options: ""Question particle"", ""Interrogative verb morphology"", ""Interrogative intonation only"", and ""Not enough information"".
I apologize for the mistake in my previous message. The correct answer is ""Not enough information"". The paragraph does not provide specific information on the strategy of forming polar questions in the described language, so it cannot be determined which of the four options is the correct one.",Not enough information,0,0,

Mian," However, it is my impression that in the Mian case the question tag offers a second
alternative which is presented as almost equally probable. Thus, the alternatives offered
in (8-125) are that the topic either is a wound or it is not a wound, with a slight bias
towards the former. In other words, bleka juxtaposes the negative to the affirmative in a
stronger fashion than question tags, such as isn’t it? or right? do in English.

Mian,"A further function of non-verbal predications is to designate locations:
(8-101) dál watobe
lál wat=o=be
river_bankacross=PRD=DECL
‘(It) is on the bank on the other side of the river’
It is important to note that (8-101) can only be used to refer to a location but not to
locate an entity at certain location. In order to do that, one has to use the existential
verb:
(8-102) Kaseninge dál=wat biebe
kasening=e lál=watbi-Ø-e=be
PN=SG.Mriver_bank=across stay.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
‘Kasening is on the other side of the river’
Non-verbal predications are also used to indicate possession. In non-verbal possessive
constructions, the predicate can be a possessive pronoun with nominal function, e.g.
némi ‘mine’, kébmi ‘yours’, nélemi ‘mine alone’, kélebmi ‘yours alone’, etc. as in (8-103)
with a topic term and (8-104) without one:
(8-103) taang élé némibe
tǎang élé némi=be
flint.N1 DEM.SG.N1 mine=DECL
‘This lighter is mine’
(8-104) némibe
némi=be
mine=DECL
‘It’s mine’
 345
Predicative possession is expressed non-verbally with the help of the noun clitic =sa
‘with’, as in (8-105) and (8-106):
(8-105) unangó amunsabe
 unǎng=oamun=sa=be
 woman=SG.F belly=with=DECL
 ‘The woman is pregnant (lit. ‘with belly’)’
(8-106) né amsabe
 né am=sa=be
 I house=with=DECL
 ‘I have a house’
8.6.1 Negation in non-verbal predications
Non-verbal predications are negated like finite verbal predications by means of the
negative marker -ba. This suffix attaches directly to the predicate without an overt
predicator. The following examples show negation of non-verbal predications
expressing identity (8-107), properties (8-108), possession (8-109) and location (8-110).
 (8-107) yeye yo yaibabo
 yeye yoyai-ba=bo
 no DIST.N2 wound-NEG=QUOT
 ‘“No, that is not a wound”’ [Pig story]
 (8-108) né monio súmbabe
 né moni=osúm-ba=be
 1SG money=N2 big-NEG=DECL
 ‘I don’t have much money’ (Lit. ‘My money isn’t big’)
 (8-109) taang élé kébmibabe — némibe
 tǎang élékébmi-ba=be —némi=be
 flint.N1 DEM.SG.N1 yours.SG.M-NEG=DECL —mine=DECL
 ‘This lighter is not yours—(it) is mine’
 (8-110) dál watbabe
 lálwat-ba=be
 river_bank across-NEG=DECL
 ‘(It) is not the bank on the other side of the river’
Pronouns as predicates in negated non-verbal predications first have to be affixed by
–kób followed by -ba. The negative suffix –kób attached to the bound pronoun series (cf.
3.7.2) and can only be found in non-verbal predications:
346
(8-111) kébta alo faeboba gese eka make nékóbbabo gese monsanibto
 kéb-taal=o fa-Ø-ebo=ba

8.6.2 Non-verbal predications in clause chaining constructions
In all examples given so far the predicate of a non-verbal predication has been followed
by an illocutionary particle which marks the end of independent and grammatically
complete sentences. However, non-verbal predications also occur in clause chaining
constructions:
(8-112) Kasening Milimab néta wengsang óló omebwat daanamabibe
 kasening milimab né-tawengsang óló
 PNPN I-EMPH story.N2 DEM.N2
 om-eb watlaa+n-ama-b-i=be

 1SG.SBJ=DECL
 ‘I’m Kasening Milimab (lit. K.M. that’s me) and I want to record this story (lit.
 take this story and put it across)’ [Dimosson story]
The predicate of a non-verbal predication within a clause chain can be followed by yé
‘there’:
(8-113) iná kakaba bobolao keimyé hekhek gabe kesoa
 ǐn=akakab=a bobol=a=okeim=yé
 liver=and lung=and heart=and=PL.N1 open=there

 panting_sound do.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ so
 ‘(his, i.e. a child’s) liver, lungs, and heart were open and he was panting, so the
 man’ [Crows]
Quite commonly, non-verbal predications in clause chains are followed by the
consecutive conjunction kesoa ‘so, that’s why’ and a consequence clause:
 347
(8-114) nai éta kesoa íle yé koubiaanibto memei yobinabiobo
 nǎi é-ta kesoa
 vagina.N1 SG.N1-EMPH so

 ‘(It) is a vagina so while fucking (in) there, they beget children’ [Pig story]
8.7 Question formation
This section deals with interrogative sentences. I will use the term “polar question” for
what is often called yes-no question in the literature. It is true that in most instances of
polar questions the speaker will expect a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as an answer, however,
strictly speaking this need not be so (cf. Comrie 1984: 18). In alternative questions, for
instance, such as Do you want pork or fish for dinner?, the speaker wants a specification of
the offered alternatives48. Alternative questions are treated as polar questions because
both display the same illocutionary marking. Also, in the most straightforward and
common case of two (or more) alternatives offered in a question, these alternatives are
mutually exclusive and thus could be seen as poles in a space of possible choices.
Questions with which the speaker requests information about the who, what, when, etc.
of an event or action I call “content questions”. Content questions consist of a
proposition which is completely presupposed apart from one element, which is the one
queried (cf. Givón 1990b: 714-5, 93).
8.7.1 Polar questions
Polar questions are formed with the interrogative particle =a. Occasionally, one finds
polar questions with =e (which is the marker for content questions).
",1,Question particle,"According to the given paragraph, the language described in the grammar forms polar questions using the interrogative particle ""=a"". Therefore, the correct option is ""Question particle"".",Question particle,0,0,
Mian," There are no interjections for the purpose of greeting people. Instead whole
formulaic sentences are exchanged. The following patterns of question and answer are
customary:
Arriving party says:Customary answer:
íbó yé bliba? — ‘Are you (pl) there?’ ae, ní yé biobobe - ‘Yes, we are there.’
klayam bieba? — ‘Are you well?’ ae, klayam blibe - ‘Yes, I am well.’
Departing party says: Customary answer:
klayam biebte! — ‘Stay well!’ klayam one! — ‘Go well!’
In the morning: Customary answer:
(klayam) seba? — ‘Did you sleep (well)?’ (ae, klayam) sibe — ‘(Yes,) I have slept
(well).’
At night: Customary anwser:
klayam aan one! — ‘(Go to) Sleep well!’ kébsa klayam aan one — ‘You too (go to) sleep
well!’
Both parties meet (on a path):Customary answer:
kóbó yé tleba? — ‘You have come to(ae,) yé tlibe ‘Yes, I have come to this place.’
this place?’
153
4 Gender
Mian, like the closely related Ok languages Telefol and Tifal, has a category ‘gender’;
i.e. nouns are lexically specified for the gender they are assigned to and require certain
agreement patterns associated with their gender (Corbett 1991, Aikhenvald 2000).
",0,Question particle,"The language described in the grammar uses ""interrogative intonation only"" as the strategy of forming polar questions.",Interrogative intonation only,1,0,polar questions
Mian,"350
The first clause in (8-119) cannot be interpreted as a question in itself either. Only the
last verb dounebbua ‘did you close?’ bears the interrogative marker a. This is not
immediately obvious from the orthography as betelaneba ‘you open’ ends in the medial
clause marker a, which is homophonous to the interrogative particle. However, there are
two cues which indicate that a in betelaneba does not mark the first clause as
interrogative but rather marks the verb as medial: (a) there is no marked pause between
the two clauses, which would be expected if each clause constituted a question in itself,
and (b) the first clause does not display characteristic polar question intonation.
The interrogative marker a can be combined with hortative verb forms in order to query
whether the addressee wants the speaker or the group of which both speaker and
addressee aremembers to perform a certain action. It seems that the use of the
interrogative marker in hortative verb forms is restricted to first person singular (8-120)
and plural (8-121):
(8-120) ayale kemelanana
 ayal=e kemela+n-an=a
 light=SG.N1 extinguish.PFV+AUX.PFV-1SG.HORT=PQ
 ‘Shall I extinguish the light?’ [Observed]
(8-121) unoma
 un-om=a
 go.PFV-1PL.INCL.HORT=PQ
 ‘Shall we go?’
8.7.1.2 Polar questions about non-verbal predications
In polar questions about non-verbal predications the interrogative particle attaches to
either a noun (8-122a), an emphatic pronoun (b), a restrictive pronoun (c), or an
adjective (d). The range of possible hosts for the clitic is exactly co-extensive with the
range of word classes that can appear in the predicate slot in declarative non-verbal
sentences. Note the morphophonemic change in the emphatic and restrictive pronouns
(see 2.7.7).
(8-122) a. tila?b. nétia?c. yótia? d. ayama?
 til=a né-ta=ayóta=aayam=a
 dog=PQI-EMPH=PQonly_this=PQgood=PQ
 ‘Is it a dog?’‘Is it me?’Is it only this?’ ‘Is it good?’
 (e.g. Is it my turn?)
351
Possible answers to these four questions are given in (8-123a-d):
(8-123) a.ae, tilobe ‘Yes, it’s a dog.’
b.ae, kébtabe ‘Yes, it’s you(r turn)!’
c.ae, yótabe ‘Yes, that’s it!’
d.yeye, ayambabe. misiamobe ‘No, it’s not good. It’s bad.’
8.7.1.3 Alternative questions
Alternative questions, in which the speaker expects the addressee to specify one (or
maybe more than one) of the alternatives offered rather than just say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, are a
subtype of polar questions. They are formed with the interrogative particle a and do not
involve change of constituent order.
(8-124) kóbó aning éta bleka eil éta dowonaamabeba?
kóboaning é-tableka
you.M.SG fish.M SG.M-EMPH or
ěil é-ta lowonaa-mab-eb=a
pig.M SG.M-EMPH eat.PFV.FUT-FUT.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=PQ
‘Do you want to eat fish or pork?’ [Observed]
The conjunction bleka ‘or’ conjoins the elements denoting the alternative options in
polar questions. The alternatives have each to be followed by an emphatic pronoun, as
in (8-124), not just an article, hence *kóbo aning=e bleka ěil=e dowonaamabeba?
8.7.1.4 Alternative questions with bleka ‘or’ as a question tag
Another way of forming an alternative question is by using bleka ‘or’ as a question tag,
e.g. in clauses with a non-verbal predicate, as in (8-125):
(8-125) yáié yai bleka?
yái=eyáibleka
wound=SG.N1 wound or
‘Is it a wound, wound, or not?’ [Pig story]
This question tag can also appear in sentences whose predicate is a finite verb, as in
(8-126):
 352
(8-126) mó wentebebta obi bleka?
mó wente-b-eb=ta o-b-i bleka
INT hear.IPFV-DS.SIM-2SG.SBJ=MED say.IMPF-IPFV-1SG.SBJ or
‘Do you understand what I’m saying, or don’t you?’
(Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m talking, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]
Tag questions in English attach to declarative (imperative or exclamative) sentences, not
to questions, and have the pragmatic function of seeking confirmation regarding the
proposition of the declarative sentence (cf. Huddleston 1988: 139).

Interrogative phrases occur in situ in Bao’an content questions. An expanded version of
the list of interrogative pronouns from §4.2.4 is given below, this time including non-
pronominal interrogative phrases.

 The nominalization of the predication as well as the use of the second person dual form to refer to a third
party who is present in the discourse context are both forms of politeness.

5.8 Interrogatives
5.8.1 Polar Questions
The most common strategy for forming a true polar question (i.e. a polar question to
which neither an affirmative nor a negative answer is expected more than the alternative)
is by means of the question suffix -u. When -u is suffixed to imperfective lexical verbs, it
replaces the imperfective suffix (-tɕi/-tɕo). Similarly, when it is suffixed to perfective
verbs, it replaces the perfective suffixes -to and -tɕə.
97
 This verbal suffix (-ro) is an allomporphic variation of the perfective suffix -to ‘PERF’.

5.8.3 Rhetorical Questions
Rhetorical questions are marked with the verbal suffix -si. In the following example, the
speaker asks this question in order to introduce an explanation of how a “soldier dance”
is performed.

 (Ləru Dancing 19)
 The suffix -si is also used to mark alternative questions forming the complement
of the verb medə ‘know’ or other interrogative complements of the verb medə ‘know’
when medə is negated.

 (Ləru Dancing 8-10)
3.2.6 Derivational Morphology
3.2.6.1 The Verbalizer -kə
The suffix -kə is used to derive verbs from nouns. In example (250) (which is repeated
from §3.1.1.1.2) the word nohkor ‘friend’ functions as a noun, while in (251) the addition
of -kə to nohkor derives the verb ‘help’. In (252) the word wela ‘work, job’ functions as
a noun, but with the addition of -kə (as in (253)) it becomes a verb (in this context
meaning ‘build’).
250) nokə aunohkor=la=nə χamda silaŋ=dao-tɕo

 ‘That man is going to Xining with (his) friends.’

(Caiguoji)
253) tɕaɕi ger wela-kə-tɕo
 Jiashi housework-VBZ-IMPF.OBJ
 ‘Jiashi is building a house.’
(Caiguoji)
The verbalizer -kə is also suffixed to borrowed verbs, regardless of their syntactic
class in the source language. In the following examples, -kə is added to the Standard
Mandarin borrowings tsʰantɕa 'participate’ and ɕuan ‘choose’, even though the words
参加 (cānjiā) and 选 (xuǎn) are already verbs in Standard Mandarin.
254) ə-naŋda kʰaŋ=gə tsʰantɕa-kə kʰər-saŋ

 so school=ACC teacher=PL 1SG.ACC choose-VBZ-PERF=QUOT.IMPF.OBJ
 ‘So the school’s teachers chose me (he said).’
(Disappointment 5)
Due to the large number of Amdo and Mandarin borrowings in Bao’an Tu, -kə is used
about as often to mark a borrowed verb as to derive a verb from a noun.
3.2.6.2 The Verbalization of Adjectives
3.2.6.2.1 The Verbalization of Color Terms
Color terms of Mongolic origin can derive verbs meaning ‘become (color)’, but the
means of deriving these verbs is irregular. The most common strategy is by replacing the
 100
rhyme of the final syllable of a color term with the suffix -e. This strategy is used with
the terms for ‘black’, ‘white’, and ‘red’.
256)χara ‘black’ →χal-e ‘become black’
tɕhəχaŋ ‘white’→ tɕhəχ-e ‘become white’
fulaŋ ‘red’→ ful-e ‘become red’
The remaining color terms of Mongolic origin derive verbs in idiosyncratic ways.
257)çəra ‘yellow’→ çərla ‘become yellow’
kʰəgo ‘blue’ → kʰəgor ‘become blue’
This completes the list of Mongolic color terms. Color terms borrowed from
Amdo Tibetan do not derive verbs, and neither do color terms whose primary denotation
is a concrete object (e.g. meŋgu ‘silver’ (n.)).
3.2.6.2.2 The Verbalization of Other Adjectives
As was mentioned in §3.1.1.1.3.1, the default syntactic strategy for expressing ‘become
ADJECTIVE’ is to attach the locative enclitic =da to the adjective and use the verb χatɕə
‘go’. This strategy can be used with all of the adjectives for which data are available. In
addition to this strategy, however, many adjectives can derive verbs by other
morphological means.

This same morpheme can also be used in response to polar or constituent
questions. With polar questions, the answer to such questions often con-
sists of a repetition of the TAMIPERsoN-syntagma marked for the passive,
although the TAMIPERsoN-syntagma in the question itself did not appear in
the passive. This use has long been noted for Kharia. E.g., Kullu (1981:
7lf.) notes this use in answers in general and gives the following example
(slightly adapted from Kullii, 1981: 72):

Alternative questions are formed simply by the use of no 'Q; or' between

'The witch angrily thinks (= she is becoming through anger like)
""Shall I eat the boy now or later?""'[BB, 1:47]
Another common strategy is to place the expression numboJ (< no+umboJ
'or not' ) at the end of an otherwise declarative statement. Alternatively,
as Malhotra (1982: 281) notes, the TAMIPERsoN-syntagma is repeated in
its negative form:
77. ho=ka[tuqa qe=nano urn «t,e=na?
that=so.HUM tomorrow come~.IRR Q NEG come~.IRR

 7.2.1 Polar questions
There are two main strategies found with polar questions:
:::::> The polar question has the same structure as the declarative, but dif-
fers with respect to intonation, rising towards the end of the utterance,
before it falls off (cf. Rehberg, 2003: 38f., 93). This is demonstrated
in the following two examples, which are only marked as questions
by intonation:
53. tay konon bhai=tejuiJ=oJno ""beghma, am
 then small brother=oBL ask=ACT.PST CMPL Beghma2so
 «t_a? uth=o~?""

 leme«t_ urn la?=ta?""
 sleep NEG EMOT==wD.PRS
 'The hare arose and said ""Friend, aren't you tired?"" '[BB, 3:21]
:::::> The second means of forming polar questions is with either the inter-
rogative particle i 'Q', which also means 'what?', or no 'Q', which is
homophonous with the complementizer and also no 'or', which prob-
ably all have the same origin. 9 Either of these may appear at the begin-
ning or, more commonly, at the end of the question (but preceding a
vocative element).

Very rarely, probably for ""poetic effect"", the interrogative may appear
elsewhere between two phonological words. The following, from a tradi-
tional song, is one of only two examples contained in our data.

 7.2.2Constituent (""wh- '') questions
Constituent questions are formed with interrogative proforms which usu-
ally appear directly before the TAMIPER.soN-syntagma, the unmarked focus
position.
59. agar botorJ=na=nirJlaJ oqoJ atuerJ=na=nirJ?

61. laJtama raij her calay[=ej?

 'Now who will lead the kingdom?'[MS, 1:180]
 SYNTAX371
Despite the tendency to place the interrogative directly before the TAM!
PERsoN-syntagma, this is not obligatory, as the following example shows.
Note that swarag 'heaven', which intervenes between the question word
and the TAMIPERSON-syntagma, is also focal in this example.
62. hokhorej=ga mo.Jl kauwa qel=ki rokontheq=ki =te

 'At that very moment a crow came and said to the birds ""Why are

The one position that is only marginally acceptable for the interrogative
element is when the interrogative follows the TAMIPERsoN-syntagma, as
all speakers only grudgingly accepted examples such as the following.

7.4Questions
Two functional types of question can be distinguished: content questions and polar ques-
tions. The formation of questions does not require any syntactic changes. The only
2427. INDEPENDENT BASIC CLAUSES
changes observed are the placement of an interrogative lexeme in the position of the re-
quested information (i.e. the interrogative proforms are used in situ), and/or a change of
the intonation pattern.
7.4.1 Content questions
Content questions use one of the interrogative proforms. Interrogative proforms in Savo-
savo are used in situ. They belong to different word classes and replace the unknown and
requested information in the corresponding declarative sentence. Table 7.5 provides a list
of question words used in Savosavo.

The paragraph only discusses content questions and the formation of questions without any syntactic changes.",Not enough information,0,0,"content questions, mentions polar questions"
Savosavo," The intonation of content questions and polar questions is not uniform, as could be
observed both in natural and elicited data. Polar questions often differ from declarative
clauses only in that the pitch peak is slightly higher in polar questions, and that it is
located on the last word. It is nonetheless followed by a drop in pitch. Because the peak

is shifted towards the end of the clause, the clause-final drop is compressed and steeper
than in declarative clauses. Figure 2.3 shows the pitch contours belonging to a polar
question (10) and the answer (11). For better comparability, only the pitch contour of

Sometimes, however, there is a rise in pitch at the end of a question, as in the content
question in (15) and the polar question in (16) (see Fig. 2.6; both show non-verbal clauses,
but the same is true for verbal clauses). The last pitch peak of the clause, preceding the
final drop, is then often not higher than in declarative clauses, thus the clause final rise
seems to make a steep rise or fall earlier in the clause unnecessary.

Polar questions, sometimes referred to in the literature as ‘yes-no questions’, can be formed
from basic verbal and non-verbal clauses by changing the intonation. The distinguishing

Wiyot," §4. ACCENT
The question of accent in Wiyot is a difficult one. One point is
clear, however, namely, that, although stress is of extremely great
importance in making the language intelligible, it is not a morphological
feature. No rules have been formulated which show where the stress
should be placed. Disyllabic words may be stressed on either syllable,
and the accent does not remain stable. That is to say, when used
independently, a word may be stressed on a certain syllable, but if the
same word is found in a sentence the accent may have shifted. The
same may be said for polysyllabic words. But should a word have as
many as four or five syllables the tendency is toward placing equal stress
on the two middle, or approximately middle, syllables. This rule is not
by any means absolute. It will also be well to remark that if more than
one syllable is stressed, the accent tends to be even on all, there being no
secondary stress. There is no doubt that the matter of stress accent is
very closely related to the question of vowel length, although a vowel
may be greatly lengthened and fail to carry the accent, or vice versa.

§18. Verb Stems
 Again the question of interpretation of verb complex arises. Three
possibilities20 present themselves: do we have a stem with prefixes; a
stem with suffixes; or the composition of coordinate stems? To answer
this question it is necessary to decide which-if only one is to be chosen-
is the true stem and which the affix; or if the stems are coordinate, why
they are considered so. Jones21 and Michelson first classified the
Algonkin stems as initial, as secondary stems of the first order, and as
secondary stems of the second order. Since the Fox grammar was
written, however, Michelson has come to the conclusion that this

O. Foreword
The present work provides a concise gramma tical description of Even (otherwise known as
Lamut), one of the Tungusic languages of Siberia. Thi s grammatical sketch differs from the pre-
vious works on Even grammar in th at 1) it is confined to synchronic description; 2) it foregrounds
the functional aspects of grammar; 3) it focuses on those lopics that are of interest from a
typological viewpoinl. The present grammatical sketch consists of three major parts. The first pan

logical introduction"", ""Morphology"", ""Syn tax "" (general infomlation, partly 10 be elaborated in wh:lI

Even,"3. 10. Interj ections an d onomatopoelics
Interjections serve to express the speaker's differenl emOlions ( erej 'Oh!', kiree 'Fie!') and voli-
tions ( gele 'Come on!'.co-co quieting an unlamed reindeer). Onomalopoetics are similar to inter-
jections both syntactically and structurally (oflen formed by reduplication): lag-lag 'rdt-tat', keeku-
keeku imi tating a cuckoo crying.
 4. Syntax: General survey
4. 1. Syntactic ty po logy
As noted above, Even, as well as the other Tungusic languages, in general follows a (nominative-)
accusative pattern. Nevertheless, it reveals certain deviations from the overall accusative typology.
On the one hand, Even displays certain ergative features in case-marki ng. First, the direct object
must stand in the (unmarked) nominative case, when followed by a renexive-possessive endi ng (see
3.2.5.). Second, in most Even dialects the Designative case can mark the intransitive subject, apart
from the direct object (see (3.2.5.». On the other hand, Even is reminiscent of ""topic-prominent""
languages in that it makes frequen t use of topicalization. The panicle bim; (historically, the condi-
tional converb of the copula bi-) following the topica lized NP serves as a topicalization marker. To-
picalization in Even applies mostly to subjects and preferably occurs in ""switch-topic"" contexts; cr.,
e.g., geeJuJci bimi 'as for the wolf...' in (I: 20). As regards word order phenomena, Even is also a Iy-
pical ""Altaic"" language, that is, a consistent head-final language. Within a nominal phrase the head
normally follows its modifier(s). Within a clause the basic word order is: SOY. This word order
pattern holds for different types of clauses (both matrix and subordinate) and sentences (declarative,
interrogative, etc.). Thus, as suggested by (3 1), foonation of interrogative (constituent) sentences
does not involve a (syntactic) wh-movement:
(31) Etiken-# ile hor-re-n?
 old man-NOM where go-NONFUT-3SG
 'Where has the old man gone?'
Yes-no questions and alternative questions are formed by addition of the enclitic particle =gu!=ku
to the verbal predicate(s):
(32) Min-u haa-s=ku, e-se-s=ku?
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Even,"Two other converbs belonging to this group differ from the above in that they are exclusively used
within periphrastic consuuctions: 4). The ""negative"" con verb fonn in -r - # - -s - ·d (depending on
verbal conjugation type) is attached to the lexical verb within the periphrastic negative construction
(see. e.g., ( 13); cf. 3.7.5.). 5) The ""negative modal"" fonn in -r,pI-ae is attached to a lexical
verb ~occurring with a negative modal auxiliary verb (such as baa- 'not want' in (45c».
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Even,"Apart from these four conjugation types the re is a di stinct negative conjugation. which is fomled
periphrastically. In th e negative conjugation the auxiliary negat ive verb e- 'not do, not be' inflects
 fo r tense/mood and person/number, whereas the lexical verb assumes the ""negati ve"" converb foml
 in -r (a) - (on its allomorphs see 3.7.6.). In the nonfuture tense the negative verb e- takes the -s(e)-
marker. as the verbs of the third declen sion , whereas in some other fonn s it displays distinct
markers ( -le- for the future tense,-c-- -c;- for the past, etc).

Even,"Finally, the group of converbs inflecting for person and number is represented by four fonns: 8)
 the condition al ""switch-reference"" converb in -rak-J-rek--aJc-J-ek--sak-f-sek---dak-l-dek- is
 semantically identical to the conditional form in -mi (naturally, except for its role in switch-
reference system); cf. (26) and (27):
 (27) Em-reke- ngoon-d'i-m
 come-COND CON-3SG say-RlT- ISG
 'If/when (s)he comes, (I) shall tell';
9) the past converb in -OSi -, normally referring to a habitual event in the past simultaneous to the
 primary event:
 (28) Hupkuti-osi-j d'uu-#-jhooc:gete-n-w
study-PAST CON-REF POShouse-NOM-REF POS very miss-PAST-1SG
'When (I) studied, (1) missed my home very much';
 10) the purposive con verb in -da-J-de-:
 (29) Gt\I:I-li tao-da-n
say-IMP:2SG read-PURP CON-3SG
'Tell him to read';
 II) the negative tenninative form in -dle- is attached only to the negative auxiliary verb e- :
 (30) Hine-dIe-s em-ree-lebi-d'i-m
your not do-NEG TERM CON-2SG come-NEG CON thi s-LOC be-FUT-ISG
'(I) shall Slay here until you come'
3_8_ Postpositions
The two types of postpOsitions available in Even are post positional nouns and postpositional ad-
 verbs. The former are half-auxiliary nouns, expressing locative relations. They serve as a fonnal
 head of a possessive-like construction. Within a poslposilionat phrase a postposition takes the cor-
 responding possessive endings 10 indicate the person and number of the lexical noun; cf. mugdeken
LW/M 12 19EVEN
herde-du-n (slump botlom-DAT-3SG) 'under the slUmp'. PoslpositionaJ adverbs are largely derived
from motion verbs and assign the Accusative case10 the objec t of postposition; cf. d'lIu-w ere/j
(house-ACe around) 'round the house'.
 3.9. Particles
All Even particles. except for the prenominal negative panicle at 'without' used within the nega-
tive proprictive form (see 3.2.6.), are enclitics. They share features with ooth syntactic words and
suffixes. Thus, they are similar to the latter in that they are also subject to vowel harmony and as-
similatory processes. On functional grounds the following groups of panicles can be preliminarily
distinguished:
a) emphatic:=si, =lal=le. =kal=ke;
b) contrastive: =pujal=puje, =kanal=kene;
c) restrictive: = lakanJ=leken (see (64», =ragdal=regde;
d) interrogative: =guJ=k,d=yu (see (32));
e) indefinite:=wull=ull=bul =nir =dal=de =gwlaI=glllte
- =wullaJ=wulie (se~ (13a»; ,
f) coordinating:=daI=de (see (65», =go/l=ge/;
g) negative:=daI=de (see (l3b)).
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Even,"The sociative adds the meaning of “doing together” to the verb. This form, alo ng
with the medio-passive was not explained in detail in my sources.
g. Other interesting characteristics of Even Grammar
g1. Vowel Harmony
As mentioned above Even displays vowel harmony. The hardness or softness of
the vowel of the suffix is determine d by the hardness or softness of the stem. Each suffix
in Even has two forms; one to be used with hard vowel stems and one to be used with
soft vowel stems. Please refer to Table 2 for the classification of hard and soft vowels. An
example of this phenomenon follows:
(22) (a) moo – la(b) moo – le
 wood-LOCATIVE water-LOCATIVE
 “in wood” “in water”
In (22), -la which contains a hard vowel is added to moo which has a hard vowel
in the stem and -le which contains a soft vowel is ad ded to moo, which has a soft vowel
in the stem.
g2. Postpositions
Even, similarly to Hungarian, makes use of postpositions in its grammar. Two
examples of these are given in (23):
(23) (a) mugdeken herde – du – n (b) d’uu – w ereli
 stumpbottom-DAT-3SG house-ACC around
 “under the stump” “round the house”

Conclusion
This paper tried to give a concise introduction to the characteristic properties of
Even grammar. Many of the concepts represented here, such as valency -altering affixes
or adjective agreement, need more careful examination. The tense/mood system of Even,
which is too complicated to describe in this paper is also an interesting topic to examine
under Even grammar.
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Even,"The adversative form can also be used to form passive sentences:
(20) Nugde - ∅ etike – m maa – n
bear-NOMold man-ACC kill-NONFUT:3SC
“The bear killed the old man”
(21) Etiken - ∅nugde-dumaa - w – ra – n

As can be seen in (20) and (21) the suffixation of the adversative–w to the verb
changes the voice of the verb into passive.
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Even,"2) Nouns that end with a “primary”–n are classified in Noun Class 2. (The
difference between a primary and secondary –n is that the latter is assumed to
have lost a vowel that was at the end of the noun stem (Malchukov, p.7).) For
example hirkan (“knife”) belongs to this class because it ends with a stem-
final primary /n/. Other examples of nouns in this class are etiken (""old man""),
awlan (""glade""), asatkan (""girl""), oran (""reindeer""), hulican (""fox"").

Exceptions to this “plural marker rule” exist. Usually kinship terms take special
plural markers –sal/-sel, -tal/-tel, -nil. For example,
(8) aman (“father”) am-til (“fathers”)
c3. Possession markers
Nouns in Even are marked for possession. These markers are either personal or
reflexive. Due to space considerations, I will not deal withthese markers in detail. The
possessive markers are different for each type of noun class. The possessive paradigm for
a class 1 noun (d’uu) would be as follows:
(9) d’uu – w (my house)

In marking the nouns for possession Even is very similar to Turkish, which is also
an Altaic agglutinating language that has an SOV word order, makes use of a case system
(though not as complicated as Even) and exhibits vowel harmony. In Turkish the
possessive paradigm for ev (“house”) would be:
(9a) ev – im (my house)
 ev – in (your(sg) house)
 ev – i (his/her/its house)
 ev – imiz (our house – Turkish has only one type of first person plural)
 ev – iniz (your(pl.) house)
 ev – leri (their house)
 ev – iniz (your(sg.)(formal) house)
We need to contrast these two languages with English. In English, possession is
not marked on nouns, instead possessive pronouns are used for indicating the possessor.

Even,"3) Noun class 3 consists of the nouns in the plural form. An example of this class
would be d'uul (""houses"").
c2. Number (Plural markers)
In Even nouns are marked for number, possession, and case. We have seen the
case markers before, now let’s look at the number marking. Singular nouns are not
marked, but plural nouns take different plural markers for different noun classes. The
plural forms of the nouns in noun class 1 take –l (example 6) and noun class 2 nouns take
–r (example 7).

Yaqui," The opportunity to do further work on Yaqui did not present
itself until the winter of 1918-1919, when the writer spent a short
time in Tucson, Arizona, working on the Papago language for the
University of California and the Southwest Society. The presence
of a small colony of Yaqui in the vicinity afforded the desired oppor-
tunity to make a few linguistic and phonetic notes which form the
basis of the present article. These were so meager, however, that
they would have been almost valueless without the assistance and
corroboration of the only extant Yaqui grammar, ""Arte de la Langua

ADVERBS
 Adverbs are normally independent parts of speech. They may
be formed from other parts of speech, as:
-siwa, suffixed to adjectives, forms adverbs
 Certain particles are intimately connected with verbs but, appar-
ently not being parts of the verbal complex, must be considered as
adverbs. Principal among these are the interrogative ki and the
negative k(a). The former is always first in the sentence and may
be separated from the verb by the nominal subject. The negative
particle seems also not to be a prefix but independent.

Yaqui," Postpositions: Case Ending
Velasco states that the relations expressed by the Latin oblique
cases-genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative-are expressed in
Cahita by the use of the case suffix -ta when the stem ends in a vowel
and -e when it ends in a consonant. These are used equally with
nouns and pronouns. Whether this is a true case ending or a very
general and comprehensive postposition, the writer is not in a position
to say.
 ye""e-m-ta (They watch that) dancer
Velasco enumerates some forty postpositions which need not be
transcribed here. He divides them into groups: 1, those suffixed to
the ablative of pronouns, or some to the nominative and some to
the oblique forms of nour,s; 2, suffixed to the ablative of pronouns
together with the preposition tzi, or to the oblique form (nominative
in one case) of the noun; 3, those suffixed to the genitive of pronouns
or nouns; 4, those which rarely or never are found with pronouns
but are used with nouns about equally in the nominative or oblique
form; 5, those which possess an adverbial sense.

Yaqui," The subject pronoun is expressed either by the full independent
form, as:
 ne""po ahwa'awi no'itik I went to the house
 i'nepo a'man we *'vaiI wish to walk there
 i'nepo ko'tc * ukI slept
 ne'spo si'mbai I wish to go
or by semipronouns, which are clipped varieties of the independent
forms and are never used alone, as:
 porke ne te'vaureBecause I am hungry
 ha'n-te' ama'niLet's go there
 ka-n-ama--weva I do not wish to go
1923] 1Mason: Preliminary Sketch of the Yaqui Language 207
These examples seem to be integral prefixes of the verb complex,
but Velasco states as one of his most infallible rules, that the pro-
nominal subject must be the second word or element in the sentence,3
so that, if the sentence contains only verb stem and pronominal sub-
ject, the latter follows the verb stem. At other times it is absolutely
separate from the verb as, to give his example, cate Diosta suale,
""Not-thou God-in believest?"" in which -(t)e is the semipronoun of
the second person singular. So unexceptionable is this rule, accord-
ingf to Velasco, that the semipronoun will fall between what cannot
but be considered as inltegral parts of the verb complex, as cot-ne-vare,
""Sleep-I-wish;"" am-ne-eria, ""Them-I-love."" Grammatical classifica-
tion is at best an academic question, but it is difficult to classify
-elements, apparently enclitics of some kind, which may stand either
after a verb stem, between a verb stem and its morphological suffixes,
or be separated from the verb by means of a noun with postposition
or case-ending, as in the above examples. Other examples, with the
elements in the order given, are: ""Here I tomorrow will-come"" and
""Tomorrow I here will-come.""
 The pronominal subject is, then,. best considered as independent
or at best enclitic to any part of speech. These semipronouns are:
 Singular Plural
1. ne te
2. eem
3. (nothing)im
 The pronominal object, of which the writer has no certain examples
in his notes, appears, judging from Velasco, to be not expressed in
the verbal complex. Velasco gives no semipronouns for the objective
 forms, as he does for the subjective and possessive relations, but
 implies that the pronominal object is always expressed by the accusa-
 tive form of the independent pronoun.

Yaqui has therefore retained its phonetic scheme comparatively
close to the original' type, apparently making only two certain shifts,
 p to v and kw to bw. By contrast, the Piman group, in addition to
 the vowel shift e to o, has made six consonantal shifts. A complete
 series of sonant stops has been built up by the changes of kw to b (a
 further development of the Yaqui shift, examples of which have
 already been given), y to d and w to g.

Apart from having the morphological characteristics of questions mentioned above, normal
yes-no (or polar) questions based on finite verbs are characterized by a fall on the last stressed

this question by the indirect relationship between a final consonant

‘who'. Occasionally, as in (51), interrogative pronouns are redupli-
cated. The pronoun sre sare ‘which’ is used with both human and
non-human referents, whereas tU tú ‘who’ is only used with human
referents. Some interrogative pronouns are also used as relative pro-
nouns, like sre sare ‘which’ in example (53). The notion ‘why?’ is
expressed by the expression SUmDane shúmátne ‘why’, sometimes spelt
SUmDanu shúmátnu. Questions containing an interrogative pronoun are
sometimes facultatively marked by the clause-final interrogative par-
ticle og gó (Q). Yes/no questions are not marked by the interrogative

4. CLITICS
 Clitics are small units that attach to the end of another word. They are distinct
from suffixes in that they can attach to any part of speech, but are like suffixes in that
they are always attached to another word. Some clitics are like adverbials by
modifying the element they attach to; other clitics have a pragmatic function of
questioning or emphasizing the word they are attached to. In many cases their exact
meaning is difficult to translate. To maintain the distinction between clitic and suffix
a dash (-) is used with suffixes and an equal sign (=) with clitics. The most common
clitic is the =s that is used to ask yes/no questions. In (34a) is an example of this
clitic attaching to a noun; further examples involve an adjective (34b), a verb (34c),
and an adverb (34d).

The appearance of a clitic interacts with the final tone of the word to which it
attaches. This phenomenon is not entirely understood at present and has been the
object of ongoing investigation by Marcia Haag (1999, 2001). The individual clitics
are explained and exemplified in the following sections. The most common pattern
seems to be for the final stress and tone to fall on the final vowel of the word to which
the clitic attaches; to indicate the place of this tone and stress an accent is placed at
the end of the word (which is usually unaccented). An example is below in (36). The
final vowel for the verb ‘to feel’ would normally be unmarked as its stress and tone
are predictable; as stated in the previous chapter, the final vowel of the full form of
the word is stressed and with a high tone. With the addition of the clitic the accent is
added to indicate that the new ending does not receive the normal final stress and
tone.

4.2 ALTERNATIVE QUESTION (AQ) =khe
 The clitic =khe presents a choice between two alternatives. The name for this
clitic comes from Lindsey (1985:40-1). In the second example the Question clitic =s
appears on the verb and the Alternative Question clitic appears on the negative

4.3 INFORMATION QUESTION (Q) =s(ko)
This clitic appears on the word that is being questioned; a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer is
the expected response to a sentence containing this clitic. This clitic is the most
common clitic in Cherokee. Its full form is =sko, but this form is rarely seen in
Oklahoma Cherokee. Five examples are in (40).

2.1.3. Negative adverbs
A small set of words modify a verb, adjective, or adverb by negating them.
The most common negative adverb is ^thla ‘not.’ When this adverb is used, the
Irrealis prepronominal prefix yi- appears on the verb being negated, as seen in
(72a).6

There are several ways to ask a ‘why’ question in Cherokee. One way is to use the
question word katoohv at the beginning of the sentence with the Iterative (ITR)
prepronominal prefix attached to the verb. Two examples are in (75).

A second way is with the question word kato and the Relativizer prepronominal
(REL) prefix ji- attached to the verb. Two examples are given in (76); in (76a) is the
basic form, whereas in (76b) this prepronominal prefix is aspirated through contact
with the /h/ in the pronominal prefix.

CHAPTER 3:GENERAL STRUCTURE OF CHEROKEE
1. WORD ORDER
1.1. GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS, ANIMACY, AND WORD ORDER
Many languages have what is referred to as a basic word order. English, for
example is described as an SVO language: a subject followed by a verb and an object
(e.g. ‘He reads the book’ or ‘I like Cherokee’). The idea of ‘basic’ word order is
problematic in Cherokee. While there are word orders that are more common than
others, it appears that, given the right context, most word orders are possible. This
variability is the result of the way in which Cherokee indicates on the verb the
participants (the subject and objects) involved in the verb. European languages to
varying degrees have suffixes on the verb that indicate what the subject of the verb is,
while objects are indicated by free-standing nouns or pronouns. Thus in those
languages transitive verbs (verbs with subjects and objects) always require an
independent word (the object) to complete the meaning. In Cherokee such free-
standing words are not necessary as the verb supplies enough information to stand on
its own as a complete sentence. Prefixes indicate the participants involved, while
suffixes indicate the tense, aspect, and mood of the verb. The prefixes do not always
indicate, however, exactly who the subject and the object of the sentence are. For
example, in the English sentence ‘he saw me’ it is readily understood that the ‘he’ is
the subject (the see-er) and ‘me’ is the object (the person being seen). The Cherokee
equivalent of the simple sentence is ambiguous, as seen in (1).
1) afqHi
aakikoohvvi
aki-kooh-vvi
1B-see:CMP-EXP
‘He/she/it saw me.’ or ‘I saw it.’
116
In this example the stem (see:CMP) and suffix indicate that an event of seeing took
place (The abbreviation CMP indicates that the verb is in a form referring to a
completed event, and the Experienced Past suffix, orEXP,indicates a past event of
which the speaker has direct knowledge). The prefix is a Set B first person singular
prefix (1B) prefix (‘I’/ ‘me’). This prefix does not itself indicate if its referent is a
subject or an object. Sentences do not typically exist in isolation, however, and the
context in which the sentence finds itself will help to determine the meaning.
Consider the example in (2).
2) n u>Dc fCafqHi
 na uuleesoot kiihl aakikoohvvi
 na uu-aleesootakiihliaki-kooh-vvi
 that 3B-skinny dog 1B-see:CMP-EXP
 ‘The skinny dog saw me.’
In this sentence only one interpretation is possible, and the prefix on the verb only
refers to the participant that is being seen; i.e. the object. This interpretation is no
longer ambiguous because of the importance of animacy and the local person/non-
local person distinction in Cherokee grammar. While aki- has multiple
interpretations, other prefixes have clear meanings that are related to whether one of
both of the participants is living. Thus to obtain the meaning ‘I saw the skinny dog’
the prefix jii- is required; this single prefix indicates that a first person singular
participant is the subject (‘I’) and a third person animate (‘him’, ‘her’ or animate ‘it’)
is the object. This sentence is presented in (3).
3) n u>Dc fCGqvi
 na uuleesoot kiihl jiikovvi
 na uu-aleesootakiihlijii-kooh-vvi
 that 3B-skinny dog 1A.AN-see:CMP-EXP
 ‘I saw that skinny dog.’
117
Animacy is thus crucial to distinguishing the subjects and objects of a Cherokee
sentence. It is important to emphasize that when a verb is transitive (with a subject
and an object), it will often indicate its participants solely through its prefixes; no
other words are necessary to produce a grammatically complete sentence. When a
noun phrase does appear, the interaction of animacy and the type of pronominal
prefix on the verb will determine if this noun phrase is the subject or object of the
verb.

Quileute,"120. All main verbs, as defined below, may functionas utterances.
Apart from these, very few Quileute words can perform this function.
The forms that are used as nouns can never^ be utterances. In
English and other languages, in answer to the question ""Who is
there?"" we may use a noun in the so-called ehptical sentence
""John."" In Quileute one must say ""It is John."" (he.xas John).
Aside from the verbal forms and interjections, the only words which
are used as utterances are the absolute numerals (Sec. 118), most
of the demonstratives, and the free morphemes e-, yes; la, indeed,
dd'kil, very well, so, (French ""done""). A negative reply cannot be
expressed by a single morpheme as in Enghsh, ""No."" It is always
necessary to affix a pronominal, temporal or aspect formative
to the negative verb, wa, or in the case of a verb of the neutral class,
(Sec. 93) the use of both negatives e- wa-, with the proper suffixes
appended to the latter. These expressions are equivalent to saying
 ""Not I,""""You wiU not,"" etc.
",,Interrogative verb morphology,,,0,0,
Quileute," 97. The composition of these forms presents an interesting
problem in linguistic analysis. From an inspection of the above
table, we can readily isolate two sets of pronominal morphemes:
-la, -lo,-lawo, and -ta, -to, -wo, -wa. On technical considerations no
objection can be raised in regard to the first set. The forms -la, -lo,
-lawo may be considered separable from the accompanying ele-
ments, since they are in one case preceded by qa- and in the other
by ti-. Furthermore, the element -ti may possibly be identical with
one morphologic factor in the obviative -sti (Sec. 100), while qa- is
identical, at least in form, with one of the signs of the passive voice
(Sec. 106), and may with less probability be one of the components
of the reflexive -sqal. Whether these coincidences argue for func-
tional identity in the present language, or are to be reckoned only
as indications of cognate origin is a question we cannot answer with
any degree of confidence in the light of the data at our disposal. The
isolation of the second series of pronominal forms contemplated
above raises more serious doubts. We may state at the outset that
the forms -ta, -to, -wo, -wa are functionally inseparable from the s-
that precedes them. They cannot be appended to any other forms,
and it is problematic whether the consonant which invariably pre-
cedes them is functionally identifiable with the verbal classifier -$
(Sec. 91), with the postpositive -s which means ""to give"" or with the

persons affix postpositive elements to this numeral, while others

Turkish," Incomplete replies to negative and other leading
questions
Negative and other leading Yes/No questions rarely receive minimal
answers, although they can, of course, receive incomplete answers. The
usage of items like 'yes' and 'no' is quite similar to that found in English:
(174)pencere -yi a~-a-ma-zm.1-slnlz?
window -Ace. open -Abil. -Neg. -Aor.",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish,"Words for 'yes', 'no', 'maybe'
There are the following short reply forms:
(170) evet'yes'
haYD' 'no'
belki 'perhaps'
These constitute the shortest possible answers to regular Yes/No
questions. However, such minimal answers are considered impolite and
are completely felicitous only as answers to copular Yes/No questions
or, in verbal questions, where the focus of the Yes/No question is not the
verb itself:
(171) Masa-run iist-utemiz mi?
table -Gen. top-3.sg. clean -Q
""Is the top of the table clean?""
Evet.
yes
(172) Ahmet dl~arl -ya nu ~lk -b?
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish,"Answers to Yes/No questions
The most salient property of answers to Yes/No questions (as opposed
to statements that are not answers to a previous question) is the use of
introductory elements like evet 'yes', haytI' 'no', elbette 'of course' and the
like. Note, however, that this is an optional property of answers.
Another property of answers is that they tend to (but do not have to)
omit those parts of the question that do not need an answer; this is a
property common to answers to Yes/No questions and WH-questions.
Thus, anyone of the answers listed below to the following question are
legitimate:
(165)Speaker A: Bu ~am slnema-ya gid-ecek mi-sin?
this evening cinema-Dat. go -Fut. -Q -2.sg.
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish,"Expecting the answer ""Yes""
The main way to ask a Yes/No question that invites the answer ""Yes"" is
by making a statement and then appending a type of negative tag
question to it, which is formed by the negative copula and the Yes/No
question particle we have seen above:
(14)Ahmet dun slnema-yagit-ti, degu mi?
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish," Neutral Yes/No questions
All the examples given in the previous section are neutral with respect to
the expected answer, i.e. whether the asker expects a ""Yes"" or a ""No"" for
an answer. Note that all three examples in the preceding section have an
affirmative verb, to which the question particle is attached. The verb
could also be in the negative; consider, for example, (13)a and (13)b,
which correspond to the examples in (12):
(13) a. yarmslnema-yagit- mi6 -yecek mi-sin?
tomorrow cinema-Dat. go- Neg. -Fut.",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish," 54
 Finally, Turkish has what I will call the general interrogative nɛ, because this particle
can be used to form multiple types of interrogatives, and would thus be the most
common. In my transcriptions it will be noted as WH, and its best literal translation is
simply „what?‟. Thus there is a set of three interrogatives – one for questioning
animates, one for inanimates, and one for questioning specific information about
nouns (i.e. for eliciting determiners).
 nɛ‟s most basic use is shown in (179) and (186):
 (179)nɛ ʧal-dɨ
WH steal-PAST
„what did he steal?‟
 (186)ayʃɛ nɛ(ji)øldyr-dy
Ayşe WH-(OBJ)kill-PAST
„what did Ayşe kill?‟
As with most direct objects, the use of the object marker is optional and related to
specificity (i.e. one includes it if they are discussing a specific referent, rather than a
general entity). This optionality is shown in (186), and also shows how the nɛ
morpheme takes regular noun morphology. The WH particle can also be used in
complex constructions with locatives, forming the interrogative „where?‟, as in
examples (188), (191), and (193).

5.5 Some Specific Constructions
5.5.1 Question Formation
The way Turkish forms questions is remarkably simple – the sentences undergo no
movement, the interrogatives take no special marking, and yes/no questions are
marked using a simple morpheme on the verb.
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish,"In yes/no questions such as (163), the morpheme {-mV} is suffixed to the verb
following the person marking. After the 2nd singular and 1st plural persons, however,
the interrogative morpheme is affixed just before the person marking, but after the
tense marker. (167) and (173) show examples of this. It is hard to say why these
specific forms would be different – a best guess would simply be that the phonology of
Turkish pushes more towards this reverse construction in these cases (or perhaps
avoids the more standard construction, possibly to avoid consonant clusters).
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish," Another very bothersome gap is the lack of contrast between /g/ and either /h/ or
/н/, especially since they are so close phonetically – the informant even calls our /н/ a
„soft g‟. My instincts, and that of the informant, would tell us that all three of these are
separate sounds, however at the moment the data may not warrant it. This is simply
because there is very little data with these sounds. There are, however, contrasts
between /h/ and /н/, and between /g/ and /k/, which means all three of the sounds in
question should be able to establish their phonemic status independently of each
16
other. So again, I think future elicitation will further support a phonemic difference
between these sounds.
3.6 Syllable Structure
 Stress always falls on the first syllable in Turkish. One extremely common word
structure is CVCVC, and in all these cases, my judgement is that the middle C belongs
to the second syllable, and not the first, and this may somehow be related to the initial
stress on the word. The exception to this is in words with two medial consonants, in
which case the first consonant often belongs to the first syllable, and the other to the
second. Of course, other times the split is CV/CCVC (e.g. toprak). That structure –
CVCCVC – is also very common in our data. Finally, the basic pattern of CVC is
practically ubiquitous. Between these three structures, I estimate that about 80-90% of
all our words are accounted for.
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Turkish,"(163)oнlan kɨz-ɨ at-dɨ-mɨ
 boy girl-OBJthrow-PAST-Q?
 „did the boy throw the girl?‟
53

 run-PROG-Q?-2SING
 „are you running?‟
 (173) kitab-ɨ oku-jaʤak-mɨ-jɨz
 book-OBJread-FUT-Q?-1PL
 „will we read the book?‟
This is the only real irregularity in Turkish interrogatives. When asking questions
which expect specific information as an answer, a simple set of interrogative pronouns
is used. These pronouns function (almost) exactly as nouns, and take all the regular
nominal morphology. The interrogative „who‟, for instance, is simply the morpheme
kim. Like regular nouns, it takes no morphology in the subject position, object marking
in the object position, and presumably standard morphology in other nominal
positions as well. (While we do not have data on the „who‟ morpheme for any other
thematic roles in the sentence, we do have such data for our other interrogatives, and
can assume that kim functions analogously). The noun being „questioned‟ is simply
replaced with the interrogative pronoun, and no movement is required. There is,
however, one instance in the data of the direct object being fronted while the
interrogative is in the subject position. Compare (180) and (182) below:
 (180) kim ajɨ-nɨnjɛmɛн-in-iʧal-dɨ
 who bear-POSSR food-POSSD-OBJsteal-PAST
 „who stole the bear‟s food?‟
 (182) ajɨ-nɨn jɛmɛн-in-i kim ʧal-dɨ
 bear-POSSRfood-POSSD-OBJ who steal-PAST
 „who stole the bear‟s food?‟
Next, the interrogative hangi is roughly equivalent to the English „which?‟, and it
replaces a DET in the sentence, as in (201):
 (201) hangi kɛdi-jiøldyr-dy
 which cat-OBJkill-PAST
 „which cat did he kill?‟
The „which‟ interrogative does not appear to take any special morphology, merely
preceding the noun it modifies. However we cannot be entirely sure as the data is
scarce.

9.2.2Content interrogation
There are three simple content interrogatives: arape 'what'; nape 'who' and ro(pe)
'where', and a complex interrogative beka ro(pe) (like where) 'how, how much'.""
The simple interrogatives function pronominally and there is no special word
order associated with questions; they replace the questioned participant in situ. The
pair in (561) show the questioning of the secondary object argument oi 'sago'.
(561) a) Oi k-ere-raivi.
 sago RL-3pL.F-Cook
 'Women are cooking sago:
b) Arlipe k-ere-raivi?
 what RL-3pL.F-Cook
 'What are they cooking?'
The above examples involve secondary object arguments that are not marked on
the verb. The pair in (562), below, show questioning ofa primary object. In these
constructions the questioned argument must also be represented on the verb and since
verb agreement is specific about number and gender, the question arises as to which
suffix to use to mark an unknown participant on the verb. At least part of the decision,
when the questioned argument is the object, must rely on presupposition or partial
knowledge of likely participants.

Mara," A question of terminology is first addressed; researchers have
used differing nomenclature for pronominal words in Tibeto-Burman
languages. The structure of intransitive sentences is then presented,
together with the set of personal pronouns and subject pronominal
words. A set of intransitive examples illustrates both required and
optional pronouns and pronominal words. Transitive sentences are
then discussed, both examples and structure, with the focus being on
the effect of combinations of agent and object pronominal words. The
pronominal words themselves are then examined in more detail. A
morphemic analysis of these words compares Weidert’s (1985) IPA
transcriptions and associated semantics to those detailed in this
101
study. Pronominal word syntax is then examined for its relevance to a
case marking pattern influenced by word order. The section
concludes by proposing a deictic hierarchy of these pronominal words
based on their order and placement relative to the verb.

6.2.4. Speaker attitude, orthography
 Speaker attitude and orthography support the hypothesis that
glottal stops are not contrastive. Unlike the case of aspiration, the
consultant often hesitated before deciding whether a word was
terminated by a glottal stop; his answer frequently required a thought
process and he would occasionally change his mind. In Lorrain’s original
orthographic system, a word-final orthographic “h” indicated a glottal
stop termination. However, current-day Mara orthography has lost any
indication of a word-final glottal stop.

minimal pairs, it is possible to form hypotheses and draw some
conclusions about contrastive sounds. This section will examine each of
the prominent features of the language: word-terminal glottal stops, the
tone system, aspiration, voicing, pre-and post-aspiration of nasals, and
dentalization. Employing minimal pairs and the property of transitivity, a
vowel contrast table is shown that suggests which vowels are likely to be
contextual variants and which in free variation. Vowel harmony is likely
to be the cause of vowel raising in both isolated words and in running
speech. Diphthongs tend to disappear in running speech.

12.3 Interrogative clauses
Although intonation is frequently an indicator of interrogative clauses across languages,
in Yine a distinct intonation contour is consistently found only in basic polar questions,
which lack interrogative morphology; see §12.3.1.1 below. With all other question
types, the intonation usually matches that of a declarative clause. Rising intonation is
optional, but not required. With the exception of the basic polar question, the interrog-
ative clause is most reliably identified by the presence of a question word or particle at
the beginning of the clause.

12.3.1Polar questions
There are two types of polar question in Yine: the basic polar question, which is
marked only by intonation, and the confirmation-type or ‘expected affirmative’ polar
question, which is introduced by the negative particle hi with the mirative enclitic =he,
and has optional rising intonation. There are no shifts in constituent order involved in
either type.
",,Question particle,,,0,0,
Piro,"318
12.3.1.1Basic polar questions
In the absence of one of the overt interrogative markers described below, intonation
alone can signal a polar question. For example, when uttered with rising intonation
the declarative clause t-apoka-tka (3SGF-arrive- PFV) ‘She has arrived’ becomes the
question ‘Has she arrived?’. As noted above, this is the only situation where a distinct
intonation contour is consistently found in Yine questions. Polar questions formed via
intonation alone do not express or imply any expectations regarding the answer.
12.3.1.2‘Expected affirmative’ polar questions
Polar questions that imply the expectation of an affirmative answer are formed from
negated clauses in Yine. In such questions, the mirative enclitic attaches to the negative
particle itself rather than to the predicate (as it does in exclamative clauses, see §12.4
below). These questions tend to have a declarative contour, but rising intonation is
optional. Example (849) illustrates an expected affirmative question (along with its
answer in (849b)) with a verbal clause; (850) illustrates that these questions can also
be formed in nonverbal clauses.

12.3.2 ‘Alternative’ questions
Alternative questions are formed by adding the ‘alternative’ particle waka and the neg-
ative noun hike ‘no’ to the clause expressing the affirmative alternative.
(851) hihi waka hike?
hihi waka hike
yes ornothing
‘Yes or no?’

‘I don’t know if they’re going to come or not.’ (DP)

expectation of an affirmative answer.

Table 12.1: Simple question terms in Yine
As their forms suggest, there are three basic question roots or themes involved: kl1,
with pronominal and adjectival functions and which forms the base for kl1ner1; kat1, a
pronominal question word reserved for human referents; and hi, the particle that serves
polysemously as an interrogative and exclamative marker, and as an adverbial question
term, as well as forming the base for both hir1 and hinaka.
12.3.3.1 kl1 ‘what, which’
Kl1 is an adjectival question word that inflects for gender and number in agreement with
the noun it questions (see §4.3.3 for discussion on adjective agreement). Its paradigm
consists of the forms kl1 (masc.sg), klo (fem.sg) and kna (plural). Like all adjectives,
321
kl1 can modify a noun (854) or itself stand in for the questioned noun phrase (855)-
(857).
(854) kl1 meçkaka panika sos1?

 ‘What is your name?’ (addressing a woman)
(857) kna hiwakni?
 knahiwaka-ni
 what+PL name- IMP. DECL
 ‘What are their names?’ (DP)
The unusual gender agreement in (856) is worth noting. The feminine form of
the question word is used here in agreement with the natural gender of the addressee;
grammatical gender is not distinguished in 2nd person forms in the language. In this
particular example, it is not possible for the question word to agree with the questioned
noun, because hiwaka ‘name of’ belongs to the set of genderless inalienable nouns (cf.
§5.1.2). Like all such nouns, hiwaka takes on the gender of its possessor; it is with this
inherited gender that klo agrees in (856). The same is also true of -meçi in (854), which
is also an inalienable noun with no inherent gender. In (854), however, the possessor
of the feathers is not known, so a different strategy is needed for deciding on the form
322
of the interrogative. In this case, the form is masculine because this is the functionally
unmarked gender in the language.
12.3.3.2 kl1ner1 ‘which, what’
Kl1ner1, a derived form of kl1, is a pronominal or adjectival question word with a more
formal or emphatic sense than kl1.4 It is derived from kl1 using the ‘being/entity’
formative -ner1 (masc)/ -nero (fem).

12.3.3.3 kat1 ‘who’
Kat1 functions as an interrogative pronoun and questions a (usually) human referent.
The final vowel is thematic, expressing gender in the singular: kat1 ’masc.sg’; kato
’fem.sg’, and probably derives historically from an inflectional marker (see §5.1.1 for
similar examples in nouns). The plural form, knane, is irregular and appears to have

The most salient pragmatic effect of this kind of incorporation is the defocusing of
the patient of a transitive construction (cf. Maksunova 2001, 2003). Thus, the direct
object of a transitive verb, which is coded externally and co-indexed by /b/ in P3, is
put right after the leftmost actant-coding morpheme of the verb (P8) - that is, it is
physically and symbolically ""incorporated"" into the verbal morpheme chain. The
resulting complex verb loses an external argument (the patient), which is
consequently no longer co-indexed in P3. Such constructions are thus typical
answers to questions like ""what are you occupied with, what are you doing all day""
and not, when the question is focussed on a possible patient (""what is it you are
making/producing at this moment"").

4.4.8Nominal verb forms
4.4.8.1Infinitive and participle
Morphologically unmarked verbal roots may be used independently, i.e. as
prosodically and grammatically autonomous words, to fulfil a variety of functions,
which invite the functional label of an ""infinitive"" form. Some uses of these semi-
nominal forms may justify the term ""participle"" as well416.
We refer to Ket infinitives as ""semi-nominal"" in character, because, in terms of
morphological behaviour, they participate in some, but not all, characteristics of
both substantive nouns and adjectives. Thus, like substantive nouns (and unlike
adjectives), infinitives may accept possessive prefixes (4.1.1.4). They also may take
case suffixes, but apart from the translative suffix -esa~ (4.1.1.3.11), there are few
unambiguous cases417.
And like adjectives (contrary to substantive nouns), Ket infinitives may be used
attributively and accept the nominalizing suffix -s (4.1.2.1). Examples for these
behavioural characteristics will be given in the remainder of this section, but we
will begin with the most verb-like use of these forms, i.e. as a complement of verbs
(and particles) of intent, movement, ceasing, and a few other ""complementable""
verbs418; the following is a fairly representative assortment of verbs/expressions,
which take infinitive-complements:
a) ability:
With the verb et IItr (a) (in) (ba/t) ""to be able to, to know how to""419:
416
Generally, we use only the term infinitive in this grammar, though.
417
In other words, the Ket infinitive is no fully declinable ""gerund"". ""Unambiguous"" means
that it is not easy to draw a clear-cut boundary between infinitive forms and outright
substantive nouns with the same shape. Thus, i¿l may be treated as the verbal infinitive
meaning ""to sing, singing"", as in, e.g. i¿l náda ""it is necessary to sing, one has to sing"" (cf.
the finite verb il Itr (il): di8-b3-il ""I sing it"", [di]8-b3-il2-il ""I sang it""), and concrete nouns
like i¿l ""song"", with its full morphological noun-like potential (including a plural éla~).
Many, but by no means all, verbal infinitives are formally identical with nouns in this way.
This may raise the question, whether concrete nouns have been dragged into the verbal
system (first, maybe, as P7 incorporates, which position may host nouns and infinitives
alike), or whether we are dealing with nominalized verbal roots here. In the absence of
overt morphological material, which would clearly differentiate both ""avatars"" of roots
with similar shape and content, there seems to be no simple answer to this question. In
some cases, lexical etymology might help, thus, if i¿l is indeed a loan from early Turkic ˜r
""song"" (and I am confident that it is, already at the Yenisei-Ostyakic stage), the concrete
noun would be primary. But this should probably not be rashly generalized to all cases of
noun-infinitive homonymy.
418
Apart from these independent uses, the most natural habitat of infinitive forms is slot P7
of complex verbs, cf. 4.4.5.2.1.4.
419
The subject of this verb is always 3rd SG impersonal, 4.4.5.6.2, and the person being
able to do something is construed as its object. The surface form given here <dabátavet>
could of course also invite a parsing with a R element bed ""to make""; that this is wrong, is
illustrated by preterite forms like <dabatómnet> da8-ba/t6-o4-b3-[i]n2-et, which show clearly
that we are dealing with b3 here.

Ket,"228A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
The following is a list of some commonly found roots which display a considerable
degree of semantic bleaching (or ""pseudo-affixhood""); it should be borne in mind
that assigning meanings/functions to morphemes is sometimes a risky business, and
always open to possible revisions; there is no universally satisfying definition of
""semantic richness"", or, for that matter, of ""concrete meaning"" vs. ""abstract
function"". The glosses are mostly copied from Vajda/Zinn 2004 (V/Z),
accompanied by page number258:
 √a ""marker of single action in some verbs"" (V/Z, p. 106)
e.g.
ta~aj7-a IItr (il) (bo/k)""to pull""
 [du]8-ta~aj7-ku/k6-(s)-a""he pulls you""
 [du]8-ta~aj7-ku/[k]6-[i]l2-a ""he pulled you""
Also claimed to be present in verbs with meanings along the lines of ""to beat"", ""to
pour"", ""to whistle"", ""to stretch"" etc. (with different P7 incorporates, but sometimes
also different conjugational patterns).
The function of this pseudo-affix R morpheme is thus very vague at best, and we
will simply gloss it as R. There is a homophonous root labelled by Vajda/Zinn as:
√a""marker in certain verbs expressing active events"" (V/Z, p. 107)
e.g.
k5-a (Itr) (in) (a) ""to slash, to cut into pieces""
 [di]8-k5-a4-b3-a ""I slash it""
 da8-k5-o4-[i]n2-a""she slashed it""
Also in verbs meaning ""to prepare firewood"", ""to bite, chew"", ""to cut in half"", ""to
split open a fish's belly"".
Given this range of meanings, it may probably be safe to view this as a
semantically ""rich"" R morpheme, meaning basically ""to cut, divide""259.
A very frequent R morpheme is
√aj ~ ij""stative marker in certain deagentive verbs"" (V/Z, p. 111)

in Vajda/Zinn as erroneous; apart from illustrating the phenomenon of bleaching and
""pseudo-affixhood"" it tries to highlight the difficulties with assigning proper
meanings/functions to these elements, and to justify our decision to resort to a dry ""R"" in
some glosses found in this grammar.
259
These are not the only R morphemes with this shape; another one is √a ""to eat"". An
equally vague semantic range is shown by another √a ""to take place of its own accord""
(Vajda/Zinn 2004, 105), uniting verbs like ""to wake up"", ""to change"", and ""to agree"". Any
answer to the question whether all these √a roots (or any subset of them) may represent on
""original"" or even ""prototypical"" semantic content can, of course, only come from deeper
historical investigations.

Ket,"26 A DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMAR OF KET
Russian. Krivonogov offers some further interesting statistics, which show that it is
mostly the older generation which still uses Ket spontaneously, or which can expect
to be addressed in Ket these days.
Asked, which language they use most in their daily lives, Ket speakers gave the
following answers (in %):
 Ket Russian both
70+5028.621.4
60-6945.238.116.7
50-595.5 70.923.6
40-496.4 78.714.9
30-392.3 83.314.4
20-291.1 86.612.3
10-190 97.32.7
0-90 97.82.2
The most dramatic caesura is obviously that between the age cohorts of the 50-59
years old (born between 1930 and 1940) and older persons. While some of the latter
have been exposed to elementary schooling in Ket in their youth, the next cohort
had to grow up in the turmoil of World War II, when fathers fought on the front and
a great number of deported persons (mainly Volga Germans and Balts) were
resettled in villages of the North (where they and their descendents still live) with
whom Russian was the only possible means of communication.
And on the question with whom and when Ket is spoken, and when other languages
are used, Krivonogov obtained the following figures (in % of those who speak Ket):
language spoken:Ket Russian (a. o. lg.)both
with parents30.323.1 23.1
with spouse 14.814.5 14.5
with siblings 10.412.5 12.5
with children 9 16.5 16.5
when working3.2 19.9 19.9
Ket, thus, is increasingly losing its social functions. It is mainly used by the elderly,
or by (adult) children communicating with their parents. From Krivonogov's data
we also learn that no single monolingual Ket speaker exists26 (and that a minuscule
ratio of 2.8 and 1.2 % admit to speak Russian only ""with (great) difficulties""); the
prospects of keeping Ket alive for more than the lifespan of the present middle
generation thus seem to be very low.
The most threatened of all Ket varieties still spoken is certainly the Central Ket
dialect, especially its subvariety that is known in the literature as the dialect of
Pakulikha. While it was chosen as the basis for the short-lived written language of
the 1930s, it is now spoken only by very few individuals, and used on a daily basis
26
 The 0.1 %, who do not speak Russian, have Sel'kup as a second language.

the expected information question particle ya which is used, but rather the

The other question type in Tshangla is the content or information question.
This question type supplies a proposition which is missing one piece of

content questions, a different sentence-final particle ya is used, and the miss-

surprising, given that words like 'no', 'not true?' etc. function as agree-
ment-solicitation tags in many languages. Speakers often reduce the nega-

(48) Mai! Jang gila abi! nong-sho!rna-phi!

 'No! It's me grandmother! Wait! Don't do it!'

 'Didn't you use to be the king's wife?'
The question in (49) is not merely a request for information, but rather
counts as an attempt by the speaker to confirm information which he
thinks to be true. This is precisely what we saw was the function of the tag
particle me. In other words, it is a short semantic distance from 'Didn't
you use to be the king's wife?' (manggi) to 'You used to be the king's wife,
right?' (me)
 The co-occurrence of the negative and interrogative categories high-
light the pragmatically marked status of a negative proposition. Whereas
a polarity question in the affirmative ('Is it true that .. .') will count as a
request for information as to the truth or falsity of a proposition, a polar-
ity question phrased in the negative ('Isn't it true that .. .') implies that a
positive answer is expected.

Hungarian,"Since the verb ""to be"" is not used in the 3rd person for the identity/characterization meaning,
nem simply precedes the adjective or noun being negated:
Nem tanár - He/she is not a teacher.
Nem okosak - They are not clever.
6. ""Lenni"" has no auxiliary function in Hungarian to express continuous (""he is coming"") or
perfect (""il est allé"") tenses. It is used, however, with the dative to express the meaning ""to
have"", but this will be discussed at another time.
7. The 6 personal pronouns are mostly self-explanatory. There is no gender distinction in the
3rd person.
Ő (he/she) and ők (they) are used for human subjects only. For animals, objects and abstract
nouns the demonstrative pronouns az (""that, it"") and azok (""those, they"") are used: az nem jó
""it's not good"", azok szépek ""they [animals, things, ideas] are pretty"".
The 2nd person pronouns and the corresponding verbal forms (sing. and plural) are used
pretty much like French ""tu"" and German ""du/ihr"". You would use these forms to address
children, close family members, friends, members of your peer group at university or in the
workplace, animals and God (assuming you speak to the last two ). Exact rules of usage are of
course quite intricate. Other people you would normally address by third person
pronouns/verbs and/or through the use of various appellatives (occupational titles etc.). But
let's leave this issue to some other time.
8. Personal pronouns are not necessary in unmarked speech - the verb ending already specifies
both the person and the number of the subject. If you do use a personal pronoun, it's for
emphasis or contrast:
Ő jön? - Is HE coming? (I already know what others are doing)
Te már itt vagy? - Are you already here? (What about the others?)
Én itt vagyok - I am here (as opposed to others who should be, but aren't...).
These contrast with unmarked forms:
Jön? - Is he coming?
Már itt vagy? - You are already here? (Mild surprise)
Itt vagyok - I am here. (Just a normal statement).
LESSON FIVE
New vocabulary
állni - to stand
futni - to run
köpni - to spit
ülni - to sit
ajtó - door
alma - apple
asztal - table
bor - wine
bűn - sin, crime
fecske - swallow (the bird)
gólya - stork
hír - news item
kert - garden
szék - chair
tető - roof
út - road
nagy - big, large
----------------------
Verbs
Last time I provided the present paradigm of the verb ""to be"". Today, I shall do the same for a
few common verbs:
állni (to stand): állok, állsz, áll, állunk, álltok, állnak
futni (to run): futok, futsz, fut, futunk, futtok, futnak
ülni (to sit): ülök, ülsz, ül, ülünk, ültök, ülnek
köpni (to spit): köpök, köpsz, köp, köpünk, köptök, köpnek
Some comments:
1. -ni is clearly the ending of the infinitive.
2. There is a connecting vowel between the stem and the ending in 4 out of the 6 forms. The
nature of this vowel depends on the vowel(s) in the stem: if the stem vowel is a back vowel,
the connecting vowel is a back vowel: o, u or a. If the last stem vowel is a front vowel, the
connecting vowel is also a front vowel: ö, ü or e. This is a manifestation of vowel harmony, a
typical feature of Uralic and Altaic languages. The rules for vowel harmony in Hungarian
can be quite complex - all I can say is that for simple verbs such as the ones here, it is
predictable.
3. There is no ending in the 3rd person singular - this is the unmarked form.
4. Where the forms of állni precede a consonant (e.g. állnak 'they stand'), the double
consonant is preserved in spelling, but it is reduced to a single consonant in pronunciation
(/a:lnOk/). This is an example of a general principle of Hungarian spelling: try to keep the
spelling of a morpheme uniform throughout the inflectional and derivational patterns.
---------------
Locative endings
We have already had the accusative ending -t. To be able to say simple sentences, we must
now introduce some nominal endings indicating location.
Hungarian does not have prepositions. Instead, it uses declensional endings and postpositions
to denote what prepositions denote in the European Indo-European languages (unlike, say,
Hindi and Japanese, which are more like Hungarian in this respect).
The first ending I introduce is -n. It means ""on"", so it will be easy to remember (this is
normally called the SUPERESSIVE case - don't let this deter you from learning it!)
When a noun ends in a vowel, the ending -n is generally simply added on to the noun:
ajtó (door) - ajtón (on the door)
tető (roof) - tetőn (on the roof)
fiú (boy) - fiún (on the boy).
One special rule: if the last vowel is a short -a or -e, this becomes long before the ending -n:
alma (apple) - almán (on the apple)
fecske (swallow [the bird]) - fecskén (on the swallow)
When the noun ends in a consonant, a connecting vowel must be inserted between the
consonant and the -n ending. This time we have three possibilities (-e-, -o-, -ö-), which obey
vowel harmony in a more complex way. Basically:
1) if the last stem vowel is -e- or -i- (short or long), the connecting vowel is -e-: kert (garden)
- kerten (on the garden), hír (news [may be singular in Hungarian]) - híren (on the news);
2) if the last stem vowel is -a-, -o- or -u- (short or long), the connecting vowel is -o-: asztal
(table) - asztalon (on the table), bor (wine) - boron (on the wine), út (road) - úton (on the
road). [Note the useful mnemonic here - the English preposition ""on"" can be translated by the
Hungarian ending -on! ];
3) if the last stem vowel is -ö- or -ü- (short or long), the connecting vowel is -ö-: könyv
(book) - könyvön (on the book), bűn (sin, crime) - bűnön (on the sin, on the crime).
EXERCISE
See if you can give me the Superessive of the nouns introduced in previous lessons:
ember - person, man (as German Mensch)
férfi - man (male adult)
nő - woman
kutya - dog
macska - cat
élet - life
isten - God
tanár - teacher
egér - mouse
-----------------------------
Some sentences with the superessive
We can now combine some newly acquired nouns and verbs to make meaningful sentences:
Állok az úton - I stand on the road.
Széken ülsz? - Are you sitting on a chair?
Van bor az asztalon? - Is there wine on the table?
Fecskék ülnek a tetőn - Swallows are sitting on the roof. [Title of a Hitchcock movie?]
-------------------------------
Important grammatical point.
I have used the term ""case"" to describe the accusative and the superessive so far. Note that,
unlike in Indo-European languages, there is no case agreement between a noun and the
adjectives qualifying it:
Látok egy piros könyvet - I see a red book.
A nagy asztalon nincs bor - There is no wine on the large table.
LESSON SIX
Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers
egy 'one' ~ első 'first'
NOTE: egy has an irregular pronunciation - it is spelled with a single <gy> but is pronounced
double, as if spelled *eggy.
kettő 'two' (reduced to két- in (most) compound numbers) ~ második 'second'
három 'three' ~ harmadik 'third'
From here on, the suffix -(linking vowel)dik is used (notice the vowel shifts for ordinal
formation - these are due to morphophonemic alternations seen in many aspects of grammar).
négy 'four' ~ negyedik 'fourth'
öt 'five' ~ ötödik 'fifth'
hat 'six' ~ hatodik 'sixth'
hét 'seven' ~ hetedik 'seventh'
nyolc 'eight' ~ nyolcadik 'eighth'
kilenc 'nine' ~ kilencedik 'ninth'
tíz 'ten' ~ tizedik 'tenth'
NOTE: Numerals between 11 and 19 are formed as follows:
11 - tizenegy ~ tizenegyedik (11th) (not *tizenelső!)
12 - tizenkettő ~ tizennkettedik (12th) (not *tizenmásodik!)
13 - tizenhárom ~ tizenharmadik (13th)
etc. (all of these forms consist of the units 1-9 being added to the superessive of 10; i.e.
Hungarians say: 1 on 10, 2 on 10 etc.)
Note: első and második are never found in compound numbers.
húsz 'twenty' ~ huszadik 'twentieth'
NOTE: Numerals between 21 and 29 are formed as follows:
21 - huszonegy ~ huszonegyedik (21st)
22 - huszonkettő ~ huszonkettedik (22nd)
23 - huszonhárom ~ huszonharmadik (23rd)
etc. (all of these forms consist of the units 1-9 being added to the superessive of 20; i.e.
Hungarians say: 1 on 20, 2 on 20 etc.)
harminc 'thirty' ~ harmincadik 'thirtieth'
NOTE: From here on, right up to 100, numerals are very simple: the decads followed by the
units, e.g.:
31 - harmincegy ~ harmincegyedik (31st)
32 - harminckettő ~ harminckettedik (32nd)
etc.
negyven 'forty' ~ negyvenedik 'fortieth'
ötven 'fifty' ~ ötvenedik 'fiftieth'
hatvan 'sixty' ~ hatvanadik 'sixtieth'
hetven 'seventy' ~ hetvenedik 'seventieth'
nyolcvan 'eighty' ~ nyolcvanadik 'eightieth'
kilencven 'ninety' ~ kilencvenedik 'ninetieth'
Now, five other noteworthy numerals are the following:
száz 'hundred' ~ századik 'hundredth'
ezer 'thousand' ~ ezredik 'thousandth'
millió 'million' ~ milliomodik 'millionth'
milliárd '[US] billion' ~ milliárdomodik 'billionth'
billió '[US] trillion' ~ billiomodik 'trillionth'
Note the continental patterns for 1E9 and 1E12.
Compound numerals are very easy, as is natural for an agglutinative language:
1956 - ezerkilencszázötvenhat
Above 2000, a hyphen is inserted between groups of 3 digits, counting from backwards:
2567 - kétezer-ötszázhatvanhét
However, this does not apply to numbers with three zeros at the end:
3000 - háromezer
--------
Some further notes:
1. As for the irregularities in the ordinals, in the case of első 'first' and második 'second' we
have suppletion, with the ordinals being related to elöl 'in front' and más 'other'.
2. On kettő vs két (two), usage is as follows:
- kettő is used:
-- in enumeration (egy, kettő, három = one, two, three);
-- when used as a noun: ketten jöttek - two (people) came (the -en form is a special case used
only with numbers which may have the same ultimate origin as the superessive, although not
always identical to it: négyen is both ""four of them"" and ""on four"", but for száz 'hundred' the
special form is százan 'one hundred of them' while the superessive is százon 'on one
hundred');
-- in arithmetic: kettő meg (or plusz) három az öt 'two plus three equal five'
- két is used as the attributive form: két fiú 'two boys', két alma 'two apples'.
3. You will note that in Hungarian the singular is used after numerals: két alma, not **két
almák. This is a very important difference between Hungarian and most IE languages
[apparently, Welsh is like Hungarian]. The accompanying verb is also in the singular: Jött
(not **Jöttek) két fiú 'two boys came'.
4. The fractional numbers are:
fél 'half'
harmad - third
negyed - quarter
ötöd - one fifth
etc.
These are combined normally with cardinals:
egyharmad - one third
kétötöd - two fifth
There is a special from for one and a half: másfél (lit. 'other half'; remember that the word for
'second' is derived from más as well: második)
5. This is a good opportunity to introduce time measurement.

Hungarian,"ALPHABET & VOWELS
But the demand is for Hungarian , so let's start with the sound system and the alphabet:
There are 7 pairs of vowels in Hungarian, spelled:
aáeéiíoóöőuúüű
The accented vowels are long, the others (including ö ü) are short. I shall be writing the long
umlaut ő with the tilde and the long umlaut ű with the circumflex, for the simple reason that
they are simpler to write on my keyboard - in any case, many Hungarians do the same. You
can look up the proper Unicode characters for these letters if you wish.
As for the pronunciation of the vowels, the long and the short vowels are pronounced alike,
with the exception of the pairs a / á and e / é.
a = [Q], more or less. It is closest to English a in all. Ex: alma 'apple'.
á = [a:], like French cave, Spanish or Italian casa. Ex: ár 'price; flood; awl; 100 sq.m.'
e = [E], like English e in pet (but not the way the Australians or NZs pronounce it!); or like
French sept. Ex: ember 'man, human being'.
é = [e:] - like French été, but longer; or like English say, but without diphthongization. Ex:
szél 'wind [n.]'
For the other vowels, the long and short versions have the same quality - they only differ in
quantity. I shall try to give the equivalents of the long vowels - it's easier to find foreign
equivalents:
í = [i:], i = [i]: Like English sea, but with no noticeable diphthongization. Exs: szív 'heart';
visz 'he carries'.
ó = [o:], o = [o]: Like North American English boat, but with no diphthongization; or like
French saute. Exs: ló 'horse'; lovak 'horses'. NOTE: Word-final -ó is always long, there is just
one word with a word-final short -o: the interjection nono! 'don't do it!' For Hungarians, even
Torontó has a long final -ó.
ő = [ø:] (I don't know the SAMBA for this!), ö = [ø]. If you know German, it's like German ö.
Or French beurre. If you must use an English analogy, as in British English pearl. Exs: nő
'woman; it's growing'; lövök 'I shoot'. NOTE: The word-final length rule is even more
absolute: any -ő at the end of the word must be long.
ú = [u:], u = [u]: Like English oo in moon, but with no noticeable diphthongization; or like
French tour. Exs: túl 'beyond'; fut 'he is running'.
ű = [y:], ü = [y]: Like German ü, or French u in dur. Exs: tű 'needle'; fül 'ear'.
------------
That's it for the vowels. No real diphthongs (except for recent loanwords like autó 'car',
Európa 'Europe'), no schwas, no tones. Stress is strong and always on the first syllable.
CONSONANTS
Today I will cover Hungarian consonantism.
Some preliminary remarks:
1. Voiceless stops are not aspirated.
2. Dental consonants are truly post-dental, as in most European languages - none of this
alveolar stuff you find in English.
3. Word-final voiced consonants remain fully voiced, unlike in German, Dutch and most
(all?) Slavic languages.
4. Just like neighbouring Slavic languages, Hungarian has a full range of palatal consonants.
But palatalization as a conditioning process does not exist: any consonant, palatal or not, can
occur before any vowel.
5. Consonants can be single or doubled, and the distinction is phonemic: néz 'he looks', nézz
'look [imperative]'.
------------------
The list of consonants, in traditional spelling order, is as follows:
b c cs d dz dzs f g gy h j k l ly m n ny p r s sz t ty v z zs
Of these, b d h k m n p t v and z call for no explanation.
c cs dz and dzs are affricates - essentially [ts] [tS] [dz] and [dZ], respectively.
gy and ty are alveolar palatal stops, similar to what you hear in British English dune and tune.
But they are definitely unitary phonemes, and despite their ""asymetrical"" spelling they are
truly a voiced-voiceless pair, articulated in the same place in the mouth. The IPA symbol for
gy is a dotless <j> with a line drawn through it, the one for ty is /c/.
j and ly are different spellings for the same phoneme: IPA /j/, or English /y/ in yard. There
was a time when ly was the palatal lateral heard in some varieties of Spanish <ll> (and
Catalan, right, Izopiru?) and in Portuguese <lh>, but this is no longer the case. But it is
important to know which spelling to use: spell bagoly 'owl' as *bagoj, and you'll be surely
labelled illiterate - Hungarians are a lot stricter on this kind of thing than English speakers.
l has the same light/dark distinction that you have in British English, and - just as in English -
this is an allophonic, not phonemic distinction. Normally, /l/ is ""light"" before a vowel and
""dark"" before a consonant or word-finally.
ny - Izopiru would be glad to learn that this has the same pronunciation as in Catalan. This is
the palatal nasal sound spelled ñ in Spanish, gn in French and Italian and nh in Portuguese.
r - this is the trilled consonant you hear in Italian, Spanish and Russian. Have a lot of fun
pronouncing it - trill away! I was 7 when I learned how to pronounce it, I still remember the
trill (and thrill) of it.
s and sz - these consonants have the opposite value from Polish: <s> = /S/ and <sz> = /s/.
zs = /Z/, as in English pleasure, or the way French, Italian and Catalan pronounce <j> and
<g> before e,i.
---------------------------------
The letters <q> and <w> are not used except in very recent loanwords (w mostly in the
physical measurement unit watt and the common word for toilet, WC /ve:ts:e/; q only in
foreign names). The letter <x> is relatively common in words of Latin and Greek origin:
export, hexaméter, etc.
The letter y is used to denote a palatal consonant: gy, ly, ny, ty. In addition, it commonly (but
not always) replaces word-final -i in family names. When so used, it tends to denote the name
of a noble family: Esterházy (where the <s> represents /s/, against the normal rules of the
language), Csáky and so on.
LESSON 1
(a) Simple sentences
Ez könyv. - This is a book.
Az könyv. - That is a book.
Ezek könyvek. - These are books.
Azok könyvek. - Those are books.
Commentary:
There is clearly no need for a verb in sentences expressing identity. At least not in the present
tense.
There is also no need for an article in such sentences. That does not mean that there is no
indefinite article in the language - there is. But we'll get to it another time.
(b) Simple questions.
Ez könyv? (with rising intonation). - Is this a book?
Igen, ez könyv. - Yes, this is a book.
Nem, ez nem könyv. - No, this is not a book.
Ezek könyvek? - Are these books?
Igen, ezek könyvek. - Yes, these are books.

Hungarian,"Definite (objective) conjugation
Without getting into this can of worms, it will be difficult to develop meaningful sentences.
Basically, all finite verb forms in Hungarian come in two varieties: definite and indefinite.
Let's take some new verbs and conjugate them with the endings we have had so far (see
Lesson 5):
ütni (to hit): ütök, ütsz, üt, ütünk, üttök, ütnek
látni (to see): látok, látsz, lát, látunk, láttok, látnak
The above are the indefinite forms. To make the definite forms, you have to use a different set
of endings:
ütni (to hit): ütöm, ütöd, üti, ütjük, ütitek, ütik
látni (to see): látom, látod, látja, látjuk, látjátok, látják.
If you compare the endings of the definite forms with those of the possessive, you'll see that
they are very similar.
Quick overview of when to use the definite and when to use the indefinite forms:
1. You use the indefinite form:
a. when there is no object:
Ki jön? - Who is coming?
Előbb ütök, aztán kérdezek - I hit first, then I ask (questions).
b. when the object is indefinite:
Látok egy kutyát. - I see a dog.
Láttok valamit? - Do you see something?
2. You use the definite form:
a. when the object is definite:
Látom a kutyát. - I see the dog.
Üti a labdát? - Is he striking the ball?
b. When the object is in the possessive (even if it's not preceded by the definite article):
Látom kutyádat. - I see your dog.
c. To express a 3rd person definite object (no personal pronoun needed):
Látod? - Do you see him/her/it?
Ütjük. - We are hitting it.
Thus we can use these resources of the language to express very simply the following
distinction:
Nem látok. - I don't see (i.e. ""I can't see"")
Nem látom. - I don't see him/her/it.

Hungarian,"The alert reader may have noticed that adjectives agree in number with the noun they are
complementary to, but remain in the singular when they qualify them.
-------------------------------
Let's introduce some people:
Ez a fiú. This is the boy.
Ez a lány. This is the girl.
Ezek a fiúk. These are the boys.
Ezek a lányok. These are the girls.
A lány okos. The girl is clever.
A fiúk okosak. The boys are clever.
A fiú nem okos. The boy is not clever.
A lányok nem okosak. The girls are not clever.
Az okos lány magyar. The clever girl is Hungarian.
Az okos fiú nem magyar. The clever boy is ot Hungarian.
-----------------------------------
Here we are at the end of LESSON 2, and we have still not seen a verb! And all the sentences
are well-formed, with the exception of a few noun phrases. The latter illustrate the fact that
qualifiers always precede the noun. Thus the famous free word order is not really free word
order at all:
ADJ. + NOUN = Qualifier + Qualified (e.g. the red book)
NOUN + ADJ. = Statement ascribing quality to the noun (e.g. the book is red).
LESSON THREE
I will still keep things simple. It's time to tackle verbs, but I will show that the unmarked form
of verbs is used for the 3rd person singular, present tense (with no definite object, but that
complication is for the future!).
New vocabulary:
egy - one; a/an (the definite article) [NB: this is one of the few irregular spellings of the
language - the word is pronounced with a double voiced palatal stop, as if spelled *eggy]
az ember - the person, man (as German Mensch)
a férfi - the man (male adult)
a nő - the woman
a kutya - the dog
a macska - the cat
az egér - the mouse
az élet - life
az isten - God
jön - comes
megy - goes
fut - runs
lát - sees
hall - hears
szép - beautiful
Thus:
A lány fut. The girl is running.
A fiú jön. The boy is coming.
A fiú lát egy kutyát. The boy sees a dog.
A kutya lát egy fiút. The dog sees a boy.
Jön az ember. (There) comes the man.
Megy a nő. (There) goes the woman.
A férfi hall egy macskát. The man hears a cat.
A macska hall egy egeret. The cat hears a mouse.
-----------------------------------
GRAMMATICAL POINTS
1. Articles have now been formally introduced. The definite article (""the"") is a before a
consonant, az before a vowel. You may recall from LESSON ONE that az also means ""that""
(the demonstrative pronoun) - the relationship is clear. Note that as a demonstrative the word
is always az, even before a consonant:
az kutya - that is a dog
a kutya - the dog
The indefinite article is egy, identical to the numeral ""one"".
Articles are used more like they are in French and German, less like in English: for example,
the definite article is required before abstract nouns:
Az élet szép. Life is beautiful.
Also, the indefinite article is not needed in expressions like:
Az könyv. That is a book.
It's not wrong to say ""Az egy könyv"", but if you say it like that there may be an emphasis on
there being other books in the world. This may be trivial, but there is definitely a difference
between:
Az Isten. That is God.
Az egy isten. That is a god.
I'd expect that no monotheist would normally use the second option!
2. I have also introduced the first of many declensional endings: the accusative -t. This must
practically always be used for the direct object (the few exceptions will come up eventually).
We have seen the plural -k already, so - rather than bore people with intricate rules - I will go
through the nouns we have covered so far, and provide both the corresponding accusative and
plural endings (you can also have both together, but that's for another time). When both
endings are added on to the bare stem, I shall just use a hyphen:
könyv: könyvet, könyvek (book)
fiú: -t, -k(boy)
lány: lányt, lányok (girl)
ember: embert, emberek (person, man)
férfi: férfit, férfiak : (man (male adult))
nő: -t, -k (woman)
kutya: kutyát, kutyák (dog)
macska: macskát, macskák (cat)
egér: egeret, egerek (mouse)
élet: életet, életek (life)
isten: istent, istenek (God)
The morphophonemics are quite complex - see if you can see some patterns already.
3. The verbs are all simple ones. Note that in the present indicative (e.g. fut) they can
correspond to both the English simple present (""he runs"") and the continuous present (""he is
running"").
4. A point of syntax: When the verb precedes the subject (e.g. jön a lány ""there comes the
girl""), this is a marked expression - there is an emphasis on the action, rather than on the
person.
LESSON FOUR
The verb ""to be"" (lenni), personal pronouns and negation.
New vocabulary
lenni - to be
tanár: tanárt, tanárok - teacher
szép - beautiful, pretty
itt - here
ott - there
már - already
The verb ""to be"" in the present tense, with attendant personal pronouns:
én vagyok - I am
te vagy - you [sing.] are
ő van - he/she is
mi vagyunk - we are
ti vagytok - you [pl.] are
ők vannak - they are
(Personal endings in bold)
---------------------
GRAMMATICAL AND USAGE POINTS
1. Clearly, the verb ""to be"" has a suppletive present tense.
2. There are three main uses of ""lenni"":
(i) Identity + characterization: okos vagy ""you are clever"", tanár vagyok ""I am a teacher"".
(ii) Physical location: itt vagyok ""I am here"", ott vagytok? ""are you there?""
(iii) Existence (English there is/are, French il y a): Van itt kutya? ""Is there a dog here?"" (in
fact it means ""are there dogs here?), vannak ott lányok? ""are there girls there?"", igen, vannak
""yes, there are"".
3. With meaning (i), the verb is omitted in the 3rd person singular and plural (in the present
tense, at any rate): ő okos ""he/she is clever"", ők tanárok ""they are teachers"".
4. Negation is always expressed by using the negative particle ""nem"" before the verb: nem
vagyok tanár ""I am not a teacher"", nem jön a fiú ""the boy is not coming"".
5. There are special combined forms for expressing negation + verb with the 3rd person forms
of the verb lenni:
nincs(en) - is not
nincsenek - are not
Examples: itt nincs kutya ""there is no dog here"", nincsenek ott ""They are not there"".
""Nincsen"" sounds (to me) a bit more formal than ""nincs"", but I don't think there is a
systematic difference between the two forms.

Hungarian,"The forms are (I will furnish a tranbslatioin for only the first two forms for each paradigm):
könyvem (my book), könyved (your book), könyve, könyvünk, könyvetek, könyvük.
lányom (my daughter), lányod (your daughter), lánya, lányunk, lányotok, lányuk.
almám (my apple), almád (your apple), almája, almánk, almátok, almájuk.
Note the intrusive -j- in the 3rd person (sing. and pl.) of nouns ending in -a: this is needed
because Hungarian does not like hiatus between vowels, and a form like **almáa would be
impossible to pronounce.
So let's see how possessives work in simple sentences:
A kutyám jó. My dog is good.
Itt van a lányod? Is your daughter here?
Fut a macskája. His/her cat is running.
Nagy a kertünk. Our garden is large.
Hol van a kutyátok? Where is you all's dog?
A tanáruk amerikai. Their teacher is American.
There are some irregularities with some nouns. One important example is fiú (boy, son). The
possessives are:
fiam (my son), fiad (your son), fia, fiunk, fiatok, fiuk (as opposed to fiúk 'boys').
Supposedly, regular possessives of the same noun are used colloquially for 'my boyfriend
etc.':
fiúm (my boyfriend), fiúd (your boyfriend), fiúja (her boyfriend). I don't know to what extent
this formation exists in the plural - Hungarian girls don't like to share their boyfriends, I
hear...
Personal pronouns with possessives
To emphasize the identity of the possessor, the personal pronoun can precede a possessive
form. Let's do this for the sentences shown above:
Az én kutyám jó. It is my dog that is good.
Itt van a te lányod? Is your daughter here?
Fut az ő macskája. His/her cat is running away.
Nagy a mi kertünk. Our garden is large.
Hol van a ti kutyátok? Where is your dog?
Az ő tanáruk amerikai. As for their teacher, he is American.
Note that in the 3rd person plural the singular ő is used, not the plural ők, in front of the
possessive. There are other cases as well where Hungarian uses the singular where in IE
languages you would expect the plural - in all these cases other features (e.g. the -uk ending)
specifies plurality.

12.3. Interrogative clauses
Depending on the type of question, interrogative clauses can contain
interrogative pronouns and question markers. Interrogative pronouns
have been treated in section 5.4. In the present section, I will look at the
different types of question markers. Following this discussion, I will
look at constituent order and general composition of questions.
12.3.1. Question markers
There are different types of questions, such as information questions
and yes / no questions. Furthermore, information questions can vary
according to the speaker’s judgement about the anticipated response to
the question, marked by the choice of question marker. Questions can
also be marked as rhetorical questions. All question markers can be

appear with a question marker, and only a few structures are not marked
this way.

12.3.1.1. -dyash ‘general information question’
General information questions are expressed by the question marker
-dyash, following the interrogative pronoun. In the following example,
dyash expresses a general information question about the name of a
person:

 how-QI-CO3M.SG 3M-DR husband
 wen-jd-ban?
 move-D J-again.M. S
‘And how did the husband come there?’ COE/JH
The interrogative pronoun can also be verbalized and derived. In this
case, -dyash follows the derived construction:

 make.noise-VY-DIR-DJ-3F.0-QI talk-VY-MI-N0-3F.SG
‘What is the story of it like.’ COE/JH
12.3.1.2. am ‘speaker expects answer’
The question particle am is used in information questions, expressing
that the speaker presupposes that the hearer knows the answer to the
question. In the following example, somebody mentioned fachdyim’,
‘arrow made of chonta-palm’, which the hearer has never heard of
before. He asks what this word means, using am, as he expects to get an
answer to his question:
(12:39) Jedye’ am m o’ fachdyim’?
thingQN 3F.SG arrow.of.chonta.palm
‘What is this fachdyim?’ COE/JH
Similarly, the speaker expects that there is an answer to the question of
how long time it takes to go up a certain mountain, knowing that the
other person has done the hike:

how-L.F QN hour.E DMgo.up-VI-NO
‘How many hours does it take to go up?’ COE/JH
Furthermore, am is in a few cases used outside of questions as a modal
particle, expressing a high probability:

‘And she (most) probably also had luck, and so it was made,
and sweet she made the chicha.’ STE/VJ
12.3.1.3. abi ’ ‘speaker does not expect answer’
The particle a bi’ is used in information questions to express that the
speaker does not expect the hearer to be able to answer the question.
Hence, questions expressed by abi ’ resemble rhetorical questions, with
the difference that in the latter, the speaker does not want an answer to
his question.

Finally, the answer to such as question can be an entire story, and when
the responder has time and knows the story, many clauses can be
required to answer this question:

‘How does her story go?’ COE/JH
Yes/no questions usually receive an emphatic particle or a negation
marker as answers. One strategy of the responder is to repeat the whole
question or part of the question in an affirmative or a negated clause, to
respond with a positive or negative answer:
(12:81 )q Jaem ’-dyajIsa- ’ aw a-m i phen-mi?

‘And are your children and you wife fine?’ COE/JH

‘We are all fine.’ COE/VC
Another way to respond wiht a negative answer is to use a negation
marker such as jam ‘no’, itsi- ‘not exist’ or daerae’ ‘not have’,
depending on the type of negation involved (10.). A negative question is
answered in the same way as a positive one, expressing the polarity of
the answer. In this way, when the answer is negative, a negation is
used:262

actant, argument, or referent high in discourse salience, including
 patients, subjects, objects, possessors, causees, and beneﬁciaries
son and Eggert 2001; cf. Anderson 1997b). For transitive verbs, the
s generally index the object (direct, indirect/primary, or even bene-
causee, depending on the particular stem). Subject marking is found
 rious intransitive verbs (see below), as well as some experiencer sub-
 semantically transitive verbs like ‘hear’, and optionally under the
ons of subject-affective agreement (Bashir 1985). Note that one and

nge of Brsk. verb stems obligatorily double-mark the person/class of
ject through the use of the class-marker preﬁxes and the subject
(51). According to Tikkanen (1995: 492), some volitional and most
 litional (non-active) intransitive verbs show this pattern, e.g., man
 e, (volitional)’ -mán ‘(non-volitional)’. As with the forms in (50h–j)
 class iv nouns do not trigger preﬁxal agreement. The doubly
subject construction occurs when the subject is not in “control” of
 ion described by the verb. The inanimate (or inactive) class iv
are canonically never in “control” of the action, and thus this lack
ble-marking is to be expected (52). 8
 at class iii inanimates trigger this double-marking suggests that the distribution is
mmatical or morpholexical rather than semantic in nature in present-day Brsk.

subjects (53). 10

lluded to above, Brsk. speakers also use possessor-raising construc-
Anderson 1995, 1997), where the person of a possessor of a bound
s marked as the verb’s argument, rather than the logical semantic
 nt itself. With transitive verbs, these additionally require the causa-
nefactive/affective marker, or at least take series-C inﬂections, the
 sed with *-a- causative stems (54).

he nature of inﬂection in Brsk. auxiliary verb constructions follows several com-
 patterns, some of which have been synchronically univerbated into massive,
 marked complexes. For more on doubled and split marking in Brsk. auxiliary
structions and typologically related phenomena, see Anderson 2006.

f the logical object (or less commonly subject), etc.

rding to Bashir (1985: 9), the a-causative is used with active transi-
 form transitive-causative and transitive-benefactive stems. With
itve stems, all the s-causative forms in Brsk. isolated from Lorimer’s
 materials are used with verbs belonging to the “non-active” class
ontrolled motion, statives, inchoatives, etc.). Thus causative stems
 to make reference to an “active” or “non-active” categorization of
 bal semantics, and this parameter determines the selection of the
usative morphemes in HBrsk., unlike in YBrsk., where the crucial
n governing the selection of one causative morpheme over the
 ccording to Berger (1974: 29), is the presence or absence of a d- pre-
h a few lexical exceptions). 11
erb stem
rb stem occupies position class 0 in the verb template. It may be a
ot, or may be morphologically complex. The range of afﬁxes within
he does note, however (1985: 9), that certain non-active intransitives form their

 sative/benefactive (or affective) preﬁxes in position -1, the plural

nd the negative preﬁx/proclitic and the interrogative sufﬁx/enclitic

 e transitive verb stems subcategorize for an object of a particular
 lass. Thus for example, the verb meaning ‘give’ has several different
depending on what the class (or class/number) of the thing given is;
mal object agreement in position -2, as in many languages of the
is with the animate recipient. Thus, if the object given is class iv.sg,
m is c}í-; if the object is iv.pl, the stem is ƒun-; while if the object is
e (i.e., belongs to class i, ii,or iii), the stem is ú- (Berger 1998: 121).

 ons are consonant alternation and presence/lack of class marking.

 ogically conditioned allomorphs) (58a) and stems subcategorized

ositon +4: Participle, converb, inﬁnitive, optative/supine
n +4 in the Brsk. verb has the most occupants. These are predomi-
 (originally) non-ﬁnite markers, some having developed into modal
he afﬁxes found in this position include the (aorist) participle in
und in most ﬁnite verbs and in non-ﬁnite/subordinate/relative-type
. This position also includes the optative/supine, the conditional,
 nitive, and the sufﬁxal part of the converb circumﬁx n-. . .-n (the
l part co-occupying position -3 with the d-preﬁx).
 aorist participle in Brsk. appears in all the ﬁnite verb forms except
atively infrequent Konativ (past/perfective screeve) and the present
ast/durative screeve). It appears as -m, often with an epenthetic
 u- or -i- (the latter preceding -i in the following syllable). It may be
in modiﬁcational functions as well as the ﬁnite verbal functions
 ned above. In the former function it nevertheless retains its internal
osyntax, e.g., subject/object marking in position-class -2, ergative
 igned to a transitive subject, etc. In addition to the aorist participle
position +4 is also occupied by the optative/supine in -is≥ and the
ve in -as. The optative/supine has a range of functions, primarily
 less frequently the formation of certain kinds of subordinate
predicate. The conditional—historically a complex of forms—syn-
ally occupies position +4 as well. For more on the functions of
lements, see 2.13 below.

 of the characteristic forms of Brsk. non-ﬁnite morphosyntax is the
b (or conjunctive participle) in (n-). . .-n, which comes in preﬁxal,
 , and circumﬁxal allomorphs. As mentioned above the converb pre-
 rt occupies the same position as the d-preverb/preﬁx, i.e., position
h which it is mutually exclusive. The sufﬁxal (or post-stem circum-
art of the converb occupies position class +4 in the Brsk. verb tem-
 ts function is mostly to mark same-subject clauses, temporally
 ng the following clause. Thus it is similar in function to conjunc-
rticiples in Indo-Aryan languages or converbs of various types in

 where the converb-marked action temporally precedes the action
main verb. Note, however, that these Brsk. forms may mark the per-

erbal form classes and verb derivation
ded to above, there are a number of different formal verb-stem

al word can be used with the auxiliary verb et- (or man- for some in-
ves) to form an inﬂectable verb stem. Modern spoken Brsk. is ﬁlled

stem couplets, and the quasi-derivational use of the causative/

rphological characteristics of Burushaski dialects
 not a monolithic entity, but rather exhibits some considerable re-
variation. The Brsk. spoken in the various villages throughout the
and Nagar valleys show a number of non-trivial differences but are
 most part remarkably similar. The dialect of Brsk. spoken in Yasin
(also known as Werchikwar) differs lexically, phonologically, and
ologically from the Hunza and Nagar variants. In the following
s, we outline some of the salient morphological characteristics of
 gar varieties of Brsk. as well (3.2).
unza versus Yasin morphology
Hunza versus Yasin nominal morphology
 rsk./NBrsk. and YBrsk. nominal systems differ in a number of note-
respects. First the pronoun system shows a number of particular-
example the use of mo for ‘she’ instead of in(e). Also, the ﬁrst and
 person singular pronouns no longer contrast the ergative and
ative cases. Rather than being an archaism in YBrsk., as one might
 given the well-known dictum on the nominative-accusative ten-
of ﬁrst and second person pronouns, this appears to be a second-
utralization in YBrsk. The ﬁrst person preserves the old ergative/
form, while the second person appears in the historically absolu-
 m. Note that the oblique stem for the second person singular is
 YBrsk.

Burushaski,"Brsk. lacks the rich derivational machinery characteristic of many
 sian languages (e.g., Turkic or Mongol), it nevertheless has several
tive derivational afﬁxes, as well as numerous lexical items and alter-
rms which suggest that a number of such afﬁxes were formerly used

 an alternation between the presence and lack of class marking as in

 most languages of South Asia (and Inner Asia), Brsk. utilizes a sys-
 expressive reduplication to create forms meaning ‘X and the like’,
 such’ (29). This type of expressive formation may even be found
ominal forms of verbs. This usually consists of a copy of the word

-um and -mo. In some forms, these are in free variation (32a), while
 rs, only one form may occur (32b–c). These attach to adverbs and
in various forms to create adjectives. The sufﬁx -um is particularly

x or preverb is a lexicalized, often discontinuous, part of the stem’s
entry. It occupies position -3 in the Brsk. verb template. In a small
r of cases, there are minimal pairs of verbs, one of which either lacks
 reﬁx while the other has it or has a non-alternating preﬁx without
 or class markers, while the other has an alternating preﬁx and per-
 cislocative meaning, to vaguely (de-)transitivizing functions, to ac-
 ject focus (Bashir 1985), to various indiosyncratic, sometimes
semantic nuances. Verbs with the d-preﬁx can be both transitive
 ransitive (45).

 the salient characteristics of Brsk. is its highly developed system of
here are several different types of cases in Brsk., roughly, grammati-
 tivated structurally, or by verbal argument subcategorization, e.g.,
en, dat [< all]), local-directional (loc, ines, superes, all[-ii], abl
 bl], inabl, ill, superabl, superlat, ades, ades-ii, ad-lat, etc.), two
f instrumentals (the k-indstrumental and the a˜e-instrumental, the
tive (an original auxiliary noun construction, see also 1.3 below),
rious lexicalized or lexically restricted local-directional and instru-
 cases. In addition to these, a further range of local case categories
 formed by combining various case elements with so-called rela-
nouns discussed in section 1.3.
forms in Brsk. nouns attach to the oblique stem, which for all
 but class ii nouns is identical to the unmarked stem; the oblique
class ii nouns is identical to the gen case (11).

umber of case forms in YBrsk. appear in a different shape than the

 compound case forms of HBrsk./NBrsk. with a secondary direc-
 lement (-c+ar, -a†+um, etc.) have for the most part been replaced by
se forms, e.g., -yakalca the Yasin allative form, comes from a fused
al noun form meaning ‘direction’ in an old allative form (the all-
ar > -ca in YBrsk.).

 different case forms of YBrsk. show an interesting patterning with
 to use in conjunctive and disjunctive constructions. Thus the erga-
 -e and the ablative in -cum appear to be used phrasally, appearing
n the rightmost (head) noun (83). The dative and genitive, on the
 and (as well as the new allative), appear on both nouns in the con-
or disjoined noun phrase (84).

omplex sentences in HBrsk. with predicates in the two clauses of

Hunza versus Yasin verbal morphology
the salient characteristics of YBrsk. verb morphology is the redu-
d repetitive/habitual. This is used with the past form of the auxiliary
a)-.

anything?”’ (Berger 1974: 104)
 class iv form of the copular verb ‘be’ in YBrsk. is dua corresponding
sk. bila (~ dila in older forms) and NBrsk. dila (Berger 1998: 129).
 (.past) is bum in YBrsk. but bom in HBrsk.
Brsk., the Konativ past (the one which lacks the aorist participle and
arked instead) is used commonly in YBrsk.

 conditional appears as a present/durative participial form with
 rticle ceq. The conditional participle appears in three forms,

 of the noteworthy aspects of Brsk. morphosyntax in general, and
 k. in particular, is the complex set of factors which interact to de-
e the nature of verb agreement, combining (hierarchical/linear)
 ic, semantic, and discourse factors (Anderson and Eggert 2001). As
ed previously, Brsk. verbs agree with their subject and object. When
ated noun phrases occur, case marking is either found only on the
 r rightmost) conjunct or on both, depending on the particular case.
 conjunctive or disjunctive objects are found, object agreement
 the closest conjunct. When conjoined subjects are used, agreement
ys plural. When disjunctive subject-NP constructions are encoun-
 n the other hand, agreement with the nearest subject is found with
 redicates, while with others, a semantically driven, global agree-
 .e., plural subject marking) is found. For examples, see (90g–m).

unza versus Nagar morphology
lly speaking, the varieties of Brsk. spoken in communities through-
Hunza and Nagar valleys differ only slightly from each other. To be
range of phonological and lexical features characteristic of each re-
ve been adduced (see Anderson 1997a for more on the comparative
 ogy of Brsk. dialects). However, various morphophonological, mor-
ical, and morphosyntactic characteristics typical of one or another
ialect can be enumerated. In terms of morphophonology, NBrsk.
s assimilatory phenomena observable within alternations between
r and plural stems, e.g., from -´lcin ‘eye’ one ﬁnds -´lci-muc in
 rather than -´lcu-muc as in HBrsk. (Berger 1998: 51).
 e of the obvious differences between NBrsk. and HBrsk. in terms of
al morphology are the variant plural forms of certain individual lex-
ound. For example, with certain monosyllabic noun stems, NBrsk.
 to preserve an older plural form with a single marker of plurality,
 Brsk. has innovated a double-marked plural formation:

8.6. Syntactic modal expressions
 sis
 In this section, I will describe non-morphologic modal expressions, which may be
called modalities, in Burushaski: obligation and necessity, concession, and tag questions.
he
As for morphological modal expressions, see §§‎6.4 – ‎6.7.
 al T
8.6.1. Obligation and necessity
 orExpressions for necessity as to what must be or what is necessary are accomplished
through two methods. The first one is a construction coded with an infinitive and a
 ct copula. This construction is used for both deontic and epistemic predications, as in
Do(245) and (246), respectively.

re
 At first, for each verb in question, I examine both i) whether there is an overt or a
covert object with it and ii) in the cases where there is an overt object, whether the
 of
reference for the object is in the identical clause to the verb or in a different clause from
 y
it. (Burushaski is the kind of language which allows argument dropping so that
rs
transitive clauses do not always have both A and O arguments overtly.) The statistical
 it
result of the examination is in Table 120 below.

Burushaski,"Un
ive
The latter type (b) is only used for the third person and only for the copular
predications which purposefully utilize the special forms to build this type of concessive
 ok
construction. This construction consists of either an imperfective pariticiple (Table 97)
 yo
or a finalis (Table 98) and a finite form of copula, both of which are conjugated from the
same copula stem, i.e. the basic form, with respect to person-number-class.

 Tag questions are used to make some tentative or confrontational nuance, mostly in
Un
conversation. Sometimes they can also be employed to function as leading question
markers.

The Burushaski tag question marker náa is attached to the end of non-interrogative
clauses, and holds rising intonation on its position up to the highest pitch in the base
ok
clauses. The following examples are the cases in which the tag question is used with an
yo
indicative clause (256), an imperative clause (257), and an obligative-indicative clause

Burushaski,"2.1.1. Word, affix, and clitics
 ign
Fo
 The word is the minimal unit which can be independently used in utterances and
re
freely alternated with any different item, which is either a word or a phrase (§2.1.2), at
the identical syntactic slot. Some words are composed of multiple morphemes, i.e. affix
of
and root, while some other words contain only a single morpheme: e.g., HZ
atésrčá [a- -i-s-γa ér-č+bá-a-m || NEG-TEL-3SG.X:II-CAUS-bend-IPFV+COP-2SG-NPRS]
 y
 rs
‘you were not bending it’ versus awá [awá || yes] ‘yes’. If a word includes different roots,
it
it is called a compound word (§7.1). There are also some words without even one root,
 Un
that is, personal prefixes (§4.2) sometimes take case suffixes directly and then the
 ive
resulting words will have no root inside: e.g., áar [a-ar || 1SG:II-DAT] ‘to me’. Any word
must have at least one accent, and some words have two or three accents: e.g., écukóon
‘his brothers’ is a word with two accents versus NG aúbaréibái ‘he does not look’ a
ok
(compound) word with three accents (about complex finite forms, see §6.4.3).
yo
There is only one clitic in Burushaski as the polar interrogative marker =a (§8.5.2),
 (T
which can be used at the syntactically fixed position, clause final. So that it can follow a
word of any word class, and this is the crucial difference between a clitic and an affix.
 sis
Affixes are not independently uttered in speech but accompany a base belonging to
specific word class(es), or occasionally an affix, to form a word. An affix carries a
he
grammatical function such as case, agreement, or derivation, rather than a concrete
 al
meaning. There are prefixes and suffixes in Burushaski, and suffixes are richer than
T
prefixes in number.
 or 2.1.2. Phrase
 ctPhrases are syntactic units which contain one word or more than one words and
Dowhich construct clauses. A single word can be the minimal part of a phrase, and a phrase
can be the minimal part of a clause. Phrases within a clause are distributed into the
hierarchic construction of the clause, and then, the same level phrases receive the same
29
 東京外国語大学博士学位論文 Doctoral thesis (Tokyo University of Foreign Studies)
treatment regardless of how many words they contain and can replace one another. Each
phrase has a head or multiple heads which belong to an identical word class and thus, a
phrase also belongs to the same word class as its head(s). For nominal phrases and
predicate (verbal) phrases, see §8.1.
 s)
 ie
2.1.3. Clause and sentence Stud
 The clause and the sentence are units difficult to distinguish, but roughly speaking,
a sentence can include clauses and a clause cannot include sentences. A clause always
ign
includes a predicate, a verb or a copula, either finite or nonfinite in my definition (§‎8.2),
however, sometimes the predicate may be omitted to all appearances if the context
 Fo
allows it. Even in these cases, the covert predicate should be invariably restored. There
 re
are some kinds of sentences which do not include any clause; for example, an
interjection can become an exclamatory sentence such as léei! ‘Hey man!’, while it has
 of
no predicate and thus it cannot be considered a clause. Comparatively a clause holds an
y
intonation but an intonational unit can be sustained over a few clauses on occasions, in
rs
particular when the successive clauses are sufficiently short. As phrases show hierarchic
 it
order, clauses are also organized into several levels and the system is usually explained
Un
with the terms coordination and subordination (§8.9). Pragmatically a clause has a topic
ive
and a comment and it can be the minimal unit for polar question, which is realised by
taking the polar interrogative enclitic =a at the final position (§8.5.2), or, very seldomly,
changing its own intonation.

2.2. Word classes
 (T
 There are 8 word classes in Burushaski: noun, pronoun, adjective, numeral, verb,
copula, conjunction, and interjection. See Figure 7 for the word classes.

It is probable that here the tense-modal suffix is -e'gwa, and that
thefirst and third person personal pronouns are, therefore, -nee
and zero. The problem is what sort of contraction has occurred in
:
the second person forms where, obviously, the suffix -e-gwa plus
some unknown quantity indicating the second person pronoun has
resulted in the form -e-gen? And, further, the third person plural
form has also been contracted in an irregular manner and, in both
cases, seems to have inserted the pronoun between the theme and
the tense-modal suffix. These questions cannot be answered since
there are no analagous contractions elsewhere in the language.

The element-ye appears to be separable from this evidence. The
question is, what element takes its place in ham'am' a-?; that is,
is the -'a of the second -w'a- simply a part of that element or the

Tonkawa,"But by far the most extensive work on Tonkawa is Hoijer’s doctoral dissertation pursued
at the University of Chicago under the guidance of Franz Boas, Edward Sapir and Leonard
Bloomfield, which he later published as an edition of the Handbook of American Indian
languages (Vol. III). The dissertation covers a number of subjects of phonology and morphology
of the language, almost to the exclusion of syntax, argument-structure, anaphora, discourse
structure and lexical semantics. The work suffers from a number of general problems. First, it
presents phonology without any reference to phonemic contrast, thus losing an entire level of
generalization (a flaw corrected in Hoijer’s later Analytical Dictionary of Tonkawa and Tonkawa
Texts). More problematic than this and its general organization (in which all questions both of
clause structure and of word structure are dealt with in a chapter on ‘morphology’) is its
idiosyncratic terminology influenced by antimentalist attitudes then prevalent in American
Structuralism, whereby a root or stem is a ‘theme’, and an ‘element’ is a level of structure above
the phone, but which lacks meaning and does not necessarily correspond to a syllable or a foot
(so that CV, CVCV, and CVC are all potential ‘simple elements’ despite appearances to the
contrary). Such terminological and analytical problems make understanding the text difficult
even for specialists.

Tonkawa,"The superficiality of the encounter, and the repeated failures in communication through
half-understood rumors and reports over the centuries to come, is emblematic of the larger lack
of knowledge about the languages and cultures of the indigenous population of Texas. Although
compared to some – the entire corpus of texts, word-lists and discussion of Coahuilteco,
Comecrudan, Maratino, Atakapan, Aranama and Karankawa in Swanton (1940) is a thin 137
pages – our knowledge of Tonkawa is relatively more complete, allowing us to understand most
basic and many detailed facts about Tonkawa morphology and phonology, much yet remains
wholly unclear. Foremost among such questions must surely rank its genetic affiliation.
Tonkawa has been connected to more than half a dozen major linguistic phyla of the New World,
often based on little more than assumption and guesswork. It has even been speculated that it
could even be an ‘Amerind-Na-Dene Mischsprache’ (Manaster-Ramer 1996b: 276), but it is safe
to say that the academic communis opinio stands against any clear connection to any known or
attested indigenous language of the New World (Goddard 1979; Mithun XX; Manaster-Ramer
1996b).
",,Interrogative verb morphology,,,0,0,
Tonkawa," Directly related to the question of genetic affiliation is the question of whether Tonkawa
has always been spoken in its historically attested ranges. The earliest historical records often do
not directly record which Indian tribe European settlers and missionaries came into contact with,
but there is suggestive evidence that the Tonkawas have long occupied the extreme southern
fringe of the Great Plains, a grassy area then rich in bison, deer and pronghorns transitioning to
black-forest prairie that today constitutes most of central Texas from around Austin stretching
northeasterly towards Dallas. It is also possible that they once occupied much of the Edwards
Plateau before being pushed onto the plains by the Lipan Apaches and Comanches within the
protohistorical period (ca. 16th-17th centuries; Newlin 1981: 4). Other tribes or bands such as the
Meyey, Yojaune and Ervipiane perhaps also spoke Tonkawa, or languages related to Tonkawa,
but of their speech essentially nothing is known. Indeed, it is indicative of the lack of information
about this people that the very name Tonkawa is not Tonkawa in origin; rather, it stems from a
Waco word tonkawéya meaning ‘they stay together’ (Hoijer 1940: 1, citing Gatschet).

Tonkawa,"The interrogative is typical in this sense. Used to create questions, instead of a –we suffix
found in the Declarative, the interrogative is formed with a glottal stop in that templatic slot as
well as another in final position, with person-number affixes falling in between. It is attested
only in the second person, singular, dual and plural; questions formed in other persons must use
other moods. It takes both present and past tense forms, as well as prospective and continuous
aspect markers (yakpa·toʔkaʔ, yakpanoʔkaʔ, etc.).

These alternative causative markers probably belong to different periods of grammaticalization
and productivity. ya- belongs to an old semi-productive series of thematic markers, relics of an
older stratum of grammatical particles that altered valence and semantic properties of the
predicate, and in many cases is no longer truly separable from the root (see e.g. Wier XX on
reduplication). ʔe(y)- by contrast belongs to a very recent layer of verb-verb compounds, and
probably means little more than ‘do X’. Neither are as productive as nes-.

Tutelo,"They were then at Var with the powerfur'and dreaded Senecas—whom
Lawson styles Sinnagers. While he was at the Sapona town, some of the
Toteras warriors came to visit their allies. Lawson was struck'with their
appearance. He describes them, in his quaint idiom, as ""tall, likely men.
having great plenty of bufialoes, elks and bears, with every sort of deer,
amongst them, which strong food makes large, robust bodies."" In another
place he adds: ""These five nations of the Toteros, Saponas, Keiauwees,
Aconechos and Schoicories are lately come amongst us, and may contain
in all about 750 men, women and children.""* It is known that the Tote-
roes (or Tuteloes) and Saponas understood each other's ^speech, and it is
highly probable that all the five tribes belonged to the same stock. They^y
had doubtless fled together from southwestern Virginia before their Iro-
quois invaders. The position in which they had taken refuge might well
 have seemed to them safe, as it placed between them and their enemies
the strong and warlike Tuscarora nation, which numbered then, accord-
ing to Lawson's estimate, twelve hundred warriors, clustered in fifteen
 towns, stretching along the Neuse and Tar rivers. Tet, even behind this
 living rampart, the feeble confederates were not secure, Lawson was
 shown, near the Sapona town, the graves of seven Indians who had been
 lately killed by the ""Sinnegars or Jennitos""—aames by which Gallatin
 understands the Senecas and Oneidas, though as regards the latter identi-
 fication there may be some question.

marked all his writings, is careful to mention that no vocabulary of the

Tutelo," The discovery of a tribe of Dakota lineage near the Atlantic coast was
so unexpected and surprising that at first it was natural to suspect some
 mistake. The idea occurred that the old Tutelo might have been a Sioux
 captive, taken in the wars which were anciently waged between the Iro-
 quois and the tribes of the far West. With the view of determining this
 point, I took the first opportunity, on my next visit to the Reserve, in
October, 1^70, of questioning the old man about his early history, and
 that of his people. His answers soon removed all doubt. He believed
himself to be a hundred and six years old and if so, his earliest recollec-
 ;
tions would go back to a time preceding by some years the Revolutionary
war. At that time his people, the Tuteloes, were living in the neighbor-
hood of two other tribes, the Saponies and the Patshenins or Botshenins.
